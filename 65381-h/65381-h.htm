  <h2 id='part1' class='c003'><abbr title='1'>I</abbr></h2>
</div>
<p class='c004'>It has more than once been suggested to
me that I should translate Homer. That
is a task for which I have neither the time
nor the courage; but the suggestion led
me to regard yet more closely a poet whom
I had already long studied, and for one
or two years the works of Homer were
seldom out of my hands. The study of
classical literature is probably on the decline;
but, whatever may be the fate of
this study in general, it is certain that, as
instruction spreads and the number of
readers increases, attention will be more
and more directed to the poetry of Homer,
not indeed as part of a classical course,
but as the most important poetical monument
existing. Even within the last ten
years two fresh translations of the <i>Iliad</i>
have appeared in England: one by a man
of great ability and genuine learning, Professor
Newman; the other by Mr Wright,
the conscientious and painstaking translator
of Dante. It may safely be asserted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>that neither of these works will take rank
as the standard translation of Homer; that
the task of rendering him will still be attempted
by other translators. It may perhaps
be possible to render to these some
service, to save them some loss of labour,
by pointing out rocks on which their predecessors
have split, and the right objects
on which a translator of Homer should fix
his attention.</p>

<p class='c005'>It is disputed what aim a translator
should propose to himself in dealing with
his original. Even this preliminary is not
yet settled. On one side it is said that the
translation ought to be such ‘that the
reader should, if possible, forget that it is a
translation at all, and be lulled into the
illusion that he is reading an original work—something
original’ (if the translation be
English), ‘from an English hand’. The
real original is in this case, it is said, ‘taken
as a basis on which to rear a poem that
shall affect our countrymen as the original
may be conceived to have affected its
natural hearers’. On the other hand, Mr
Newman, who states the foregoing doctrine
only to condemn it, declares that he ‘aims
at precisely the opposite: to retain every
peculiarity of the original, so far as he is
able, <i>with the greater care the more foreign it
may happen to be</i>’; so that it may ‘never
be forgotten that he is imitating, and
imitating in a different material’. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>translator’s ‘first duty’, says Mr Newman
‘is a historical one, to be <i>faithful</i>’. Probably
both sides would agree that the translator’s
‘first duty is to be faithful’; but
the question at issue between them is, in
what faithfulness consists.</p>

<p class='c005'>My one object is to give practical advice
to a translator; and I shall not the least
concern myself with theories of translation
as such. But I advise the translator not
to try ‘to rear on the basis of the <i>Iliad</i>, a
poem that shall affect our countrymen as
the original may be conceived to have
affected its natural hearers’; and for this
simple reason, that we cannot possibly tell
<i>how</i> the <i>Iliad</i> ‘affected its natural hearers’.
It is probably meant merely that he should
try to affect Englishmen powerfully, as
Homer affected Greeks powerfully; but
this direction is not enough, and can give
no real guidance. For all great poets affect
their hearers powerfully, but the effect of
one poet is one thing, that of another poet
another thing: it is our translator’s business
to reproduce the effect of Homer, and the
most powerful emotion of the unlearned
English reader can never assure him whether
he has <i>re</i>produced this, or whether he has
produced something else. So, again, he
may follow Mr Newman’s directions, he may
try to be ‘faithful’, he may ‘retain every
peculiarity of his original’; but who is to
assure him, who is to assure Mr Newman
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>himself, that, when he has done this, he
has done that for which Mr Newman enjoins
this to be done, ‘adhered closely to
Homer’s manner and habit of thought’?
Evidently the translator needs some more
practical directions than these. No one can
tell him how Homer affected the Greeks;
but there are those who can tell him how
Homer affects <i>them</i>. These are scholars;
who possess, at the same time with knowledge
of Greek, adequate poetical taste and
feeling. No translation will seem to them
of much worth compared with the original;
but they alone can say whether the translation
produces more or less the same effect
upon them as the original. They are the
only competent tribunal in this matter:
the Greeks are dead; the unlearned Englishman
has not the data for judging; and no
man can safely confide in his own single
judgment of his own work. Let not the
translator, then, trust to his notions of what
the ancient Greeks would have thought of
him; he will lose himself in the vague.
Let him not trust to what the ordinary
English reader thinks of him; he will be
taking the blind for his guide. Let him not
trust to his own judgment of his own work;
he may be misled by individual caprices.
Let him ask how his work affects those who
both know Greek and can appreciate poetry;
whether to read it gives the Provost of
Eton, or Professor Thompson at Cambridge,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>or Professor Jowett here in Oxford, at all
the same feeling which to read the original
gives them. I consider that when Bentley
said of Pope’s translation, ‘It was a pretty
poem, but must not be called Homer’, the
work, in spite of all its power and attractiveness,
was judged.</p>

<p class='c005'><span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ὡς ἂν ὁ φρόνιμος ὁρίσειεν</span>, ‘as the judicious
would determine’, that is a test to
which everyone professes himself willing
to submit his works. Unhappily, in most
cases, no two persons agree as to who ‘the
judicious’ are. In the present case, the
ambiguity is removed: I suppose the translator
at one with me as to the tribunal to
which alone he should look for judgment;
and he has thus obtained a practical test by
which to estimate the real success of his
work. How is he to proceed, in order that
his work, tried by this test, may be found
most successful?</p>

<p class='c005'>First of all, there are certain negative
counsels which I will give him. Homer has
occupied men’s minds so much, such a
literature has arisen about him, that every
one who approaches him should resolve
strictly to limit himself to that which may
directly serve the object for which he approaches
him. I advise the translator to
have nothing to do with the questions,
whether Homer ever existed; whether the
poet of the <i>Iliad</i> be one or many; whether
the <i>Iliad</i> be one poem or an <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><i>Achilleis</i></span> and an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span><i>Iliad</i> stuck together; whether the Christian
doctrine of the Atonement is shadowed
forth in the Homeric mythology; whether
the Goddess Latona in any way prefigures
the Virgin Mary, and so on. These are
questions which have been discussed with
learning, with ingenuity, nay, with genius;
but they have two inconveniences,—one
general for all who approach them, one
particular for the translator. The general
inconvenience is that there really exist no
data for determining them. The particular
inconvenience is that their solution by the
translator, even were it possible, could be
of no benefit to his translation.</p>

<p class='c005'>I advise him, again, not to trouble himself
with constructing a special vocabulary for
his use in translation; with excluding a
certain class of English words, and with
confining himself to another class, in obedience
to any theory about the peculiar
qualities of Homer’s style. Mr Newman
says that ‘the entire dialect of Homer being
essentially archaic, that of a translator
ought to be as much Saxo-Norman as possible,
and owe as little as possible to the
elements thrown into our language by classical
learning’. Mr Newman is unfortunate
in the observance of his own theory; for I
continually find in his translation words of
Latin origin, which seem to me quite alien
to the simplicity of Homer,—‘responsive’,
for instance, which is a favourite word of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>Mr Newman, to represent the Homeric
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀμειβόμενος</span>:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Great Hector of the motley helm thus spake to her <i>responsive</i>.</div>
      <div class='line'>But thus <i>responsively</i> to him spake godlike Alexander.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>And the word ‘celestial’ again, in the grand
address of Zeus to the horses of Achilles,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>You, who are born <i>celestial</i>, from Eld and Death exempted!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>seems to me in that place exactly to jar upon
the feeling as too bookish. But, apart from
the question of Mr Newman’s fidelity to
his own theory, such a theory seems to me
both dangerous for a translator and false
in itself. Dangerous for a translator; because,
wherever one finds such a theory
announced (and one finds it pretty often),
it is generally followed by an explosion of
pedantry; and pedantry is of all things in the
world the most un-Homeric. False in itself;
because, in fact, we owe to the Latin element
in our language most of that very rapidity
and clear decisiveness by which it is contradistinguished
from the German, and in
sympathy with the languages of Greece and
Rome: so that to limit an English translator
of Homer to words of Saxon origin is
to deprive him of one of his special advantages
for translating Homer. In Voss’s
well-known translation of Homer, it is precisely
the qualities of his German language
itself, something heavy and trailing both
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>in the structure of its sentences and in the
words of which it is composed, which prevent
his translation, in spite of the hexameters,
in spite of the fidelity, from creating
in us the impression created by the Greek.
Mr Newman’s prescription, if followed,
would just strip the English translator of
the advantage which he has over Voss.</p>

<p class='c005'>The frame of mind in which we approach
an author influences our correctness of appreciation
of him; and Homer should be
approached by a translator in the simplest
frame of mind possible. Modern sentiment
tries to make the ancient not less than the
modern world its own; but against modern
sentiment in its applications to Homer the
translator, if he would feel Homer truly—and
unless he feels him truly, how can
he render him truly?—cannot be too
much on his guard. For example: the
writer of an interesting article on English
translations of Homer, in the last number
of the <i>National Review</i>, quotes, I see, with
admiration, a criticism of Mr Ruskin on the
use of the epithet <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φυσίζοος</span>, ‘life-giving’,
in that beautiful passage in the third book
of the <i>Iliad</i>, which follows Helen’s mention
of her brothers Castor and Pollux as alive,
though they were in truth dead:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὣς φάτο· τοὺς δ’ ἤδη κατέχεν φυσίζοος αἶα</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐν Λακεδαίμονι αὖθι, φίλῃ ἐν πατρίδι γαίῃ</span>.<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c009'><sup>[1]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>‘The poet’, says Mr Ruskin, ‘has to speak
of the earth in sadness; but he will not let
that sadness affect or change his thought of
it. No; though Castor and Pollux be dead,
yet the earth is our mother still,—fruitful,
life-giving’. This is a just specimen of that
sort of application of modern sentiment to
the ancients, against which a student, who
wishes to feel the ancients truly, cannot too
resolutely defend himself. It reminds one,
as, alas! so much of Mr Ruskin’s writing
reminds one, of those words of the most
delicate of living critics: <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“Comme tout
genre de composition a son écueil particulier,
<i>celui du genre romanesque, c’est le faux</i>”.</span>
The reader may feel moved as he reads it;
but it is not the less an example of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">‘le faux’</span>
in criticism; it is false. It is not true, as
to that particular passage, that Homer called
the earth <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φυσίζοος</span> because, ‘though he had
to speak of the earth in sadness, he would
not let that sadness change or affect his
thought of it’, but consoled himself by considering
that ‘the earth is our mother still,—fruitful,
life-giving’. It is not true, as a
matter of general criticism, that this kind of
sentimentality, eminently modern, inspires
Homer at all. ‘From Homer and Polygnotus
I every day learn more clearly’,
says Goethe, ‘that in our life here above
ground we have, properly speaking, to enact
Hell’<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c009'><sup>[2]</sup></a>:—if the student must absolutely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>have a keynote to the <i>Iliad</i>, let him take
this of Goethe, and see what he can do with
it; it will not, at any rate, like the tender
pantheism of Mr Ruskin, falsify for him the
whole strain of Homer.</p>

<p class='c005'>These are negative counsels; I come to
the positive. When I say, the translator
of Homer should above all be penetrated
by a sense of four qualities of his author;—that
he is eminently rapid; that he is
eminently plain and direct, both in the
evolution of his thought and in the expression
of it, that is, both in his syntax and in
his words; that he is eminently plain and
direct in the substance of his thought, that
is, in his matter and ideas; and, finally
that he is eminently noble;—I probably
seem to be saying what is too general to be
of much service to anybody. Yet it is
strictly true that, for want of duly penetrating
themselves with the first-named
quality of Homer, his rapidity, Cowper
and Mr Wright have failed in rendering
him; that, for want of duly appreciating
the second-named quality, his plainness
and directness of style and dictation, Pope
and Mr Sotheby have failed in rendering
him; that for want of appreciating the
third, his plainness and directness of ideas,
Chapman has failed in rendering him;
while for want of appreciating the fourth,
his nobleness, Mr Newman, who has clearly
seen some of the faults of his predecessors,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>has yet failed more conspicuously than any
of them.</p>

<p class='c005'>Coleridge says, in his strange language,
speaking of the union of the human soul
with the divine essence, that this takes place</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Whene’er the mist, which stands ’twixt God and thee,</div>
      <div class='line'>Defecates to a pure transparency;</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>and so, too, it may be said of that union
of the translator with his original, which
alone can produce a good translation, that
it takes place when the mist which stands
between them—the mist of alien modes of
thinking, speaking, and feeling on the translator’s
part—‘defecates to a pure transparency’,
and disappears. But between
Cowper and Homer—(Mr Wright repeats in
the main Cowper’s manner, as Mr Sotheby
repeats Pope’s manner, and neither Mr
Wright’s translation nor Mr Sotheby’s has,
I must be forgiven for saying, any proper
reason for existing)—between Cowper and
Homer there is interposed the mist of
Cowper’s elaborate Miltonic manner, entirely
alien to the flowing rapidity of Homer;
between Pope and Homer there is interposed
the mist of Pope’s literary artificial
manner, entirely alien to the plain naturalness
of Homer’s manner; between Chapman
and Homer there is interposed the mist of
the fancifulness of the Elizabethan age,
entirely alien to the plain directness of
Homer’s thought and feeling; while between
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>Mr Newman and Homer is interposed
a cloud of more than Egyptian thickness,—namely,
a manner, in Mr Newman’s version,
eminently ignoble, while Homer’s manner
is eminently noble.</p>

<p class='c005'>I do not despair of making all these propositions
clear to a student who approaches
Homer with a free mind. First, Homer is
eminently rapid, and to this rapidity the
elaborate movement of Miltonic blank verse
is alien. The reputation of Cowper, that
most interesting man and excellent poet,
does not depend on his translation of Homer;
and in his preface to the second edition, he
himself tells us that he felt,—he had too
much poetical taste not to feel,—on returning
to his own version after six or seven
years, ‘more dissatisfied with it himself
than the most difficult to be pleased of all
his judges’. And he was dissatisfied with
it for the right reason,—that ‘it seemed to
him deficient <i>in the grace of ease</i>’. Yet
he seems to have originally misconceived
the manner of Homer so much, that it is
no wonder he rendered him amiss. ‘The
similitude of Milton’s manner to that of
Homer is such’, he says, ‘that no person
familiar with both can read either without
being reminded of the other; and it is in
those breaks and pauses to which the
numbers of the English poet are so much
indebted, both for their dignity and variety,
that he chiefly copies the Grecian’. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>would be more true to say: ‘The unlikeness
of Milton’s manner to that of Homer
is such, that no person familiar with both
can read either without being struck with
his difference from the other; and it is in
his breaks and pauses that the English poet
is most unlike the Grecian’.</p>

<p class='c005'>The inversion and pregnant conciseness
of Milton or Dante are, doubtless, most impressive
qualities of style; but they are
the very opposites of the directness and
flowingness of Homer, which he keeps alike
in passages of the simplest narrative, and
in those of the deepest emotion. Not only,
for example, are these lines of Cowper un-Homeric:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>So numerous seemed those fires the banks between</div>
      <div class='line'>Of Xanthus, blazing, and the fleet of Greece</div>
      <div class='line'>In prospect all of Troy;</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>where the position of the word ‘blazing’
gives an entirely un-Homeric movement to
this simple passage, describing the fires of
the Trojan camp outside of Troy; but the
following lines, in that very highly-wrought
passage where the horse of Achilles answers
his master’s reproaches for having left
Patroclus on the field of battle, are equally
un-Homeric:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>For not through sloth or tardiness on us</div>
      <div class='line'>Aught chargeable, have Ilium’s sons thine arms</div>
      <div class='line'>Stript from Patroclus’ shoulders; but a God</div>
      <div class='line'>Matchless in battle, offspring of bright-haired</div>
      <div class='line'>Latona, him contending in the van</div>
      <div class='line'>Slew, for the glory of the chief of Troy.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>Here even the first inversion, ‘have Ilium’s
sons thine arms Stript from Patroclus’
shoulders’, gives the reader a sense of a
movement not Homeric; and the second
inversion, ‘a God him contending in the van
Slew’, gives this sense ten times stronger.
Instead of moving on without check, as
in reading the original, the reader twice
finds himself, in reading the translation,
brought up and checked. Homer moves
with the same simplicity and rapidity
in the highly-wrought as in the simple
passage.</p>

<p class='c005'>It is in vain that Cowper insists on his
fidelity: ‘my chief boast is that I have
adhered closely to my original’:—‘the
matter found in me, whether the reader like
it or not, is found also in Homer; and the
matter not found in me, how much soever
the reader may admire it, is found only in
Mr Pope’. To suppose that it is <i>fidelity</i> to
an original to give its matter, unless you at
the same time give its manner; or, rather,
to suppose that you can really give its
matter at all, unless you can give its manner,
is just the mistake of our pre-Raphaelite
school of painters, who do not understand
that the peculiar effect of nature resides in
the whole and not in the parts. So the
peculiar effect of a poet resides in his manner
and movement, not in his words taken separately.
It is well known how conscientiously
literal is Cowper in his translation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>of Homer. It is well known how extravagantly
free is Pope.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in16'>So let it be!</div>
      <div class='line'>Portents and prodigies are lost on me;</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>that is Pope’s rendering of the words,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>

      <div class='line'><span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ξάνθε, τί μοι θάνατον μαντεύεαι; οὐδέ τί σε χρή·</span><a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c009'><sup>[3]</sup></a></div>

      <div class='line'>Xanthus, why prophesiest thou my death to me? thou needest not at all:</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>yet, on the whole, Pope’s translation of the
<i>Iliad</i> is more Homeric than Cowper’s, for
it is more rapid.</p>

<p class='c005'>Pope’s movement, however, though rapid,
is not of the same kind as Homer’s; and
here I come to the real objection to rhyme
in a translation of Homer. It is commonly
said that rhyme is to be abandoned in a
translation of Homer, because ‘the exigencies
of rhyme’, to quote Mr Newman,
‘positively forbid faithfulness’; because
‘a just translation of any ancient poet in
rhyme’, to quote Cowper, ‘is impossible’.
This, however, is merely an accidental objection
to rhyme. If this were all, it might
be supposed, that if rhymes were more
abundant Homer could be adequately translated
in rhyme. But this is not so; there
is a deeper, a substantial objection to rhyme
in a translation of Homer. It is, that rhyme
inevitably tends to pair lines which in the
original are independent, and thus the movement
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>of the poem is changed. In these
lines of Chapman, for instance, from Sarpedon’s
speech to Glaucus, in the twelfth
book of the <i>Iliad</i>:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in18'>O friend, if keeping back</div>
      <div class='line'>Would keep back age from us, and death, and that we might not wrack</div>
      <div class='line'>In this life’s human sea at all, but that deferring now</div>
      <div class='line'>We shunned death ever,—nor would I half this vain valor show,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor glorify a folly so, to wish thee to advance;</div>
      <div class='line'>But since we <i>must</i> go, though not here, and that besides the chance</div>
      <div class='line'>Proposed now, there are infinite fates, etc.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Here the necessity of making the line,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Nor glorify a folly so, to wish thee to advance,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>rhyme with the line which follows it, entirely
changes and spoils the movement of the
passage.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in8'><span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">οὔτε κεν αὐτὸς ἐνὶ πρώτοισι μαχοίμην,</span></div>

      <div class='line'>Nor would I urge thee on to enter the glorious battle,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>says Homer; there he stops, and begins an
opposed movement:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">νῦν δ’—ἔμπης γὰρ Κῆρες ἐφεστᾶσιν θανάτοιο—</span></div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>But—for a thousand fates of death stand close to us always—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>This line, in which Homer wishes to go away
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>with the most marked rapidity from the
line before, Chapman is forced, by the necessity
of rhyming, intimately to connect
with the line before.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>But since we <i>must</i> go, though not here, and that besides the chance.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The moment the word <i>chance</i> strikes our
ear, we are irresistibly carried back to <i>advance</i>
and to the whole previous line, which,
according to Homer’s own feeling, we ought
to have left behind us entirely, and to be
moving farther and farther away from.</p>

<p class='c005'>Rhyme certainly, by intensifying antithesis,
can intensify separation, and this
is precisely what Pope does; but this balanced
rhetorical antithesis, though very
effective, is entirely un-Homeric. And this
is what I mean by saying that Pope fails to
render Homer, because he does not render
his plainness and directness of style and
diction. Where Homer marks separation
by moving away, Pope marks it by antithesis.
No passage could show this better
than the passage I have just quoted, on
which I will pause for a moment.</p>

<p class='c005'>Robert Wood, whose <i>Essay on the Genius
of Homer</i> is mentioned by Goethe as one of
the books which fell into his hands when
his powers were first developing themselves,
and strongly interested him, relates of this
passage a striking story. He says that in
1762, at the end of the Seven Years’ War,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>being then Under-Secretary of State, he was
directed to wait upon the President of the
Council, Lord Granville, a few days before
he died, with the preliminary articles of the
Treaty of Paris. ‘I found him’, he continues,
‘so languid, that I proposed postponing
my business for another time; but
he insisted that I should stay, saying, it
could not prolong his life to neglect his
duty; and repeating the following passage
out of Sarpedon’s speech, he dwelled with
particular emphasis on the third line, which
recalled to his mind the distinguishing part
he had taken in public affairs:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὦ πέπον, εἰ μὲν γὰρ, πόλεμον περὶ τόνδε φυγόντε,</span></div>

      <div class='line'><span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μυρίαι, ἃς οὐκ ἔστι φυγεῖν βρότον, οὐδ’ ὑπαλύξαι—</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἴομεν.</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>His Lordship repeated the last word several
times with a calm and determinate resignation;
and, after a serious pause of some
minutes, he desired to hear the Treaty read,
to which he listened with great attention,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>and recovered spirits enough to declare the
approbation of a dying statesman (I use his
own words) “on the most glorious war,
and most honourable peace, this nation ever
saw”’<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c009'><sup>[6]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c005'>I quote this story, first, because it is
interesting as exhibiting the English aristocracy
at its very height of culture, lofty spirit,
and greatness, towards the middle of the
18th century. I quote it, secondly, because
it seems to me to illustrate Goethe’s saying
which I mentioned, that our life, in Homer’s
view of it, represents a conflict and a hell;
and it brings out, too, what there is tonic
and fortifying in this doctrine. I quote it,
lastly, because it shows that the passage is
just one of those in translating which Pope
will be at his best, a passage of strong
emotion and oratorical movement, not of
simple narrative or description.</p>

<p class='c005'>Pope translates the passage thus:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Could all our care elude the gloomy grave</div>
      <div class='line'>Which claims no less the fearful than the brave,</div>
      <div class='line'>For lust of fame I should not vainly dare</div>
      <div class='line'>In fighting fields, nor urge thy soul to war:</div>
      <div class='line'>But since, alas! ignoble age must come,</div>
      <div class='line'>Disease, and death’s inexorable doom;</div>
      <div class='line'>The life which others pay, let us bestow,</div>
      <div class='line'>And give to fame what we to nature owe.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Nothing could better exhibit Pope’s prodigious
talent; and nothing, too, could be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>better in its own way. But, as Bentley
said, ‘You must not call it Homer’. One
feels that Homer’s thought has passed
through a literary and rhetorical crucible,
and come out highly intellectualised; come
out in a form which strongly impresses us,
indeed, but which no longer impresses us
in the same way as when it was uttered by
Homer. The antithesis of the last two
lines—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The life which others pay, let us bestow,</div>
      <div class='line'>And give to fame what we to nature owe</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>is excellent, and is just suited to Pope’s
heroic couplet; but neither the antithesis
itself, nor the couplet which conveys it,
is suited to the feeling or to the movement
of the Homeric <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἴομεν</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'>A literary and intellectualised language
is, however, in its own way well suited to
grand matters; and Pope, with a language
of this kind and his own admirable talent,
comes off well enough as long as he has
passion, or oratory, or a great crisis to deal
with. Even here, as I have been pointing
out, he does not render Homer; but he and
his style are in themselves strong. It is
when he comes to level passages, passages
of narrative or description, that he and his
style are sorely tried, and prove themselves
weak. A perfectly plain direct style can
of course convey the simplest matter as
naturally as the grandest; indeed, it must
be harder for it, one would say, to convey
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>a grand matter worthily and nobly, than to
convey a common matter, as alone such a
matter should be conveyed, plainly and
simply. But the style of Rasselas is incomparably
better fitted to describe a sage
philosophising than a soldier lighting his
camp-fire. The style of Pope is not the
style of Rasselas; but it is equally a literary
style, equally unfitted to describe a simple
matter with the plain naturalness of Homer.</p>

<p class='c005'>Everyone knows the passage at the end
of the eighth book of the <i>Iliad</i>, where the
fires of the Trojan encampment are likened
to the stars. It is very far from my wish
to hold Pope up to ridicule, so I shall not
quote the commencement of the passage,
which in the original is of great and celebrated
beauty, and in translating which
Pope has been singularly and notoriously
fortunate. But the latter part of the passage,
where Homer leaves the stars, and
comes to the Trojan fires, treats of the plainest,
most matter-of-fact subject possible,
and deals with this, as Homer always deals
with every subject, in the plainest and
most straightforward style. ‘So many in
number, between the ships and the streams
of Xanthus, shone forth in front of Troy
the fires kindled by the Trojans. There
were kindled a thousand fires in the plain;
and by each one there sat fifty men in the
light of the blazing fire. And the horses,
munching white barley and rye, and standing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>by the chariots, waited for the bright-throned
Morning<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c009'><sup>[7]</sup></a>’.</p>

<p class='c005'>In Pope’s translation, this plain story
becomes the following:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>So many flames before proud Ilion blaze,</div>
      <div class='line'>And brighten glimmering Xanthus with their rays;</div>
      <div class='line'>The long reflections of the distant fires</div>
      <div class='line'>Gleam on the walls, and tremble on the spires.</div>
      <div class='line'>A thousand piles the dusky horrors gild,</div>
      <div class='line'>And shoot a shady lustre o’er the field.</div>
      <div class='line'>Full fifty guards each flaming pile attend,</div>
      <div class='line'>Whose umbered arms, by fits, thick flashes send;</div>
      <div class='line'>Loud neigh the coursers o’er their heaps of corn,</div>
      <div class='line'>And ardent warriors wait the rising morn.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>It is for passages of this sort, which, after
all, form the bulk of a narrative poem, that
Pope’s style is so bad. In elevated passages
he is powerful, as Homer is powerful,
though not in the same way; but in plain
narrative, where Homer is still powerful and
delightful, Pope, by the inherent fault of
his style, is ineffective and out of taste.
Wordsworth says somewhere, that wherever
Virgil seems to have composed ‘with his eye
on the object’, Dryden fails to render him.
Homer invariably composes ‘with his eye
on the object’, whether the object be a
moral or a material one: Pope composes
with his eye on his style, into which he translates
his object, whatever it is. That, therefore,
which Homer conveys to us immediately,
Pope conveys to us through a medium.
He aims at turning Homer’s sentiments
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>pointedly and rhetorically; at investing
Homer’s description with ornament and
dignity. A sentiment may be changed by
being put into a pointed and oratorical
form, yet may still be very effective in that
form; but a description, the moment it
takes its eyes off that which it is to describe,
and begins to think of ornamenting itself,
is worthless.</p>

<p class='c005'>Therefore, I say, the translator of Homer
should penetrate himself with a sense of the
plainness and directness of Homer’s style;
of the simplicity with which Homer’s
thought is evolved and expressed. He has
Pope’s fate before his eyes, to show him
what a divorce may be created even between
the most gifted translator and Homer by an
artificial evolution of thought and a literary
cast of style.</p>

<p class='c005'>Chapman’s style is not artificial and
literary like Pope’s nor his movement elaborate
and self-retarding like the Miltonic
movement of Cowper. He is plain-spoken,
fresh, vigorous, and, to a certain degree,
rapid; and all these are Homeric qualities.
I cannot say that I think the movement of
his fourteen-syllable line, which has been
so much commended, Homeric; but on
this point I shall have more to say by and
by, when I come to speak of Mr Newman’s
metrical exploits. But it is not distinctly
anti-Homeric, like the movement of Milton’s
blank verse; and it has a rapidity of its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>own. Chapman’s diction, too, is generally
good, that is, appropriate to Homer; above
all, the syntactical character of his style is
appropriate. With these merits, what prevents
his translation from being a satisfactory
version of Homer? Is it merely
the want of literal faithfulness to his original,
imposed upon him, it is said, by the exigencies
of rhyme? Has this celebrated
version, which has so many advantages,
no other and deeper defect than that?
Its author is a poet, and a poet, too, of the
Elizabethan age; the golden age of English
literature as it is called, and on the whole
truly called; for, whatever be the defects
of Elizabethan literature (and they are
great), we have no development of our
literature to compare with it for vigour
and richness. This age, too, showed what
it could do in translating, by producing a
master-piece, its version of the Bible.</p>

<p class='c005'>Chapman’s translation has often been
praised as eminently Homeric. Keats’s fine
sonnet in its honour everyone knows; but
Keats could not read the original, and
therefore could not really judge the translation.
Coleridge, in praising Chapman’s
version, says at the same time, ‘It will
give you small idea of Homer’. But the
grave authority of Mr Hallum pronounces
this translation to be ‘often exceedingly
Homeric’; and its latest editor boldly
declares that by what, with a deplorable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>style, he calls ‘his own innative Homeric
genius’, Chapman ‘has thoroughly identified
himself with Homer’; and that ‘we
pardon him even for his digressions, for
they are such as we feel Homer himself
would have written’.</p>

<p class='c005'>I confess that I can never read twenty
lines of Chapman’s version without recurring
to Bentley’s cry, ‘This is not Homer!’
and that from a deeper cause than any unfaithfulness
occasioned by the fetters of
rhyme.</p>

<p class='c005'>I said that there were four things which
eminently distinguished Homer, and with a
sense of which Homer’s translator should
penetrate himself as fully as possible. One
of these four things was, the plainness and
directness of Homer’s ideas. I have just
been speaking of the plainness and directness
of his style; but the plainness and
directness of the contents of his style, of his
ideas themselves, is not less remarkable.
But as eminently as Homer is plain, so
eminently is the Elizabethan literature in
general, and Chapman in particular, fanciful.
Steeped in humours and fantasticality up
to its very lips, the Elizabethan age, newly
arrived at the free use of the human faculties
after their long term of bondage, and delighting
to exercise them freely, suffers from
its own extravagance in this first exercise
of them, can hardly bring itself to see an
object quietly or to describe it temperately.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>Happily, in the translation of the Bible,
the sacred character of their original inspired
the translators with such respect that they
did not dare to give the rein to their own
fancies in dealing with it. But, in dealing
with works of profane literature, in dealing
with poetical works above all, which highly
stimulated them, one may say that the
minds of the Elizabethan translators were
<i>too</i> active; that they could not forbear
importing so much of their own, and this
of a most peculiar and Elizabethan character,
into their original, that they effaced
the character of the original itself.</p>

<p class='c005'>Take merely the opening pages to Chapman’s
translation, the introductory verses,
and the dedications. You will find:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>An Anagram of the name of our Dread Prince,</div>
      <div class='line'>My most gracious and sacred Mæcenas,</div>
      <div class='line'>Henry, Prince of Wales,</div>
      <div class='line'>Our Sunn, Heyr, Peace, Life,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Henry, son of James the First, to whom
the work is dedicated. Then comes an
address,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>To the sacred Fountain of Princes,</div>
      <div class='line'>Sole Empress of Beauty and Virtue, Anne, Queen</div>
      <div class='line in14'>Of England, etc.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>All the Middle Age, with its grotesqueness,
its conceits, its irrationality, is still in these
opening pages; they by themselves are
sufficient to indicate to us what a gulf
divides Chapman from the ‘clearest-souled’
of poets, from Homer, almost as great a gulf
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>as that which divides him from Voltaire.
Pope has been sneered at for saying that
Chapman writes ‘somewhat as one might
imagine Homer himself to have written
before he arrived at years of discretion’.
But the remark is excellent: Homer expresses
himself like a man of adult reason,
Chapman like a man whose reason has not
yet cleared itself. For instance, if Homer
had had to say of a poet, that he hoped his
merit was now about to be fully established
in the opinion of good judges, he was as
incapable of saying this as Chapman says
it,—‘Though truth in her very nakedness
sits in so deep a pit, that from Gades to
Aurora, and Ganges, few eyes can sound
her, I hope yet those few here will so discover
and confirm that the date being out
of her darkness in this morning of our poet,
he shall now gird his temples with the sun’,—I
say, Homer was as incapable of saying
this in that manner, as Voltaire himself
would have been. Homer, indeed, has
actually an affinity with Voltaire in the unrivalled
clearness and straightforwardness
of his thinking; in the way in which he
keeps to one thought at a time, and puts
that thought forth in its complete natural
plainness, instead of being led away from
it by some fancy striking him in connection
with it, and being beguiled to wander off
with this fancy till his original thought,
in its natural reality, knows him no more.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>What could better show us how gifted a
race was this Greek race? The same
member of it has not only the power of
profoundly touching that natural heart of
humanity which it is Voltaire’s weakness
that he cannot reach, but can also address
the understanding with all Voltaire’s admirable
simplicity and rationality.</p>

<p class='c005'>My limits will not allow me to do more
than shortly illustrate, from Chapman’s
version of the <i>Iliad</i>, what I mean when I
speak of this vital difference between Homer
and an Elizabethan poet in the quality of
their thought; between the plain simplicity
of the thought of the one, and the curious
complexity of the thought of the other.
As in Pope’s case, I carefully abstain from
choosing passages for the express purpose
of making Chapman appear ridiculous;
Chapman, like Pope, merits in himself all
respect, though he too, like Pope, fails to
render Homer.</p>

<p class='c005'>In that tonic speech of Sarpedon, of
which I have said so much, Homer, you may
remember, has:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in6'><span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">εἰ μὲν γὰρ, πόλεμον περὶ τόνδε φυγόντε,</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αἰεὶ δὴ μέλλοιμεν ἀγήρω τ’ ἀθανάτω τε</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἔσσεσθ’—</span></div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in12'>if indeed, but once <i>this</i> battle avoided,</div>
      <div class='line'>We were for ever to live without growing old and immortal—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Chapman cannot be satisfied with this, but
must add a fancy to it:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in24'><span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>if keeping back</div>
      <div class='line'>Would keep back age from us, and death, and <i>that we might not wrack</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>In this life’s human sea at all</i>;</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>and so on. Again; in another passage
which I have before quoted, where Zeus says
to the horses of Peleus,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in6'><span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τί σφῶϊ δόμεν Πηλῆϊ ἀνάκτι</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θνητῷ; ὑμεῖς δ’ ἐστὸν ἀγήρω τ’ ἀθανάτω τε</span>·<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c009'><sup>[8]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Why gave we you to royal Peleus, to a mortal?</div>
      <div class='line'>but ye are without old age, and immortal.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Chapman sophisticates this into:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Why gave we you t’ a mortal king, when immortality</div>
      <div class='line'>And <i>incapacity of age so dignifies your states</i>?</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Again; in the speech of Achilles to his
horses, where Achilles, according to Homer,
says simply ‘Take heed that ye bring your
master safe back to the host of the Danaans,
in some other sort than the last time, when
the battle is ended’, Chapman sophisticates
this into:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>When with blood, for this day’s fast observed, revenge shall yield</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>Our heart satiety</i>, bring us off.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>In Hector’s famous speech, again, at his
parting from Andromache, Homer makes
him say: ‘Nor does my own heart so bid
me’ (to keep safe behind the walls), ‘since
I have learned to be staunch always, and to
fight among the foremost of the Trojans,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>busy on behalf of my father’s great glory,
and my own<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c009'><sup>[9]</sup></a>’. In Chapman’s hands this
becomes:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in16'>The spirit I first did breathe</div>
      <div class='line'>Did never teach me that; much less, since the contempt of death</div>
      <div class='line'>Was settled in me, <i>and my mind knew what a worthy was,</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>Whose office is to lead in fight, and give no danger pass</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>Without improvement. In this fire must Hector’s trial shine:</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>Here must his country, father, friends, be in him made divine.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>You see how ingeniously Homer’s plain
thought is <i>tormented</i>, as the French would
say, here. Homer goes on: ‘For well I
know this in my mind and in my heart,
the day will be, when sacred Troy shall
perish’—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἔσσεται ἦμαρ, ὅτ’ ἄν ποτ’ ὀλώλῃ Ἴλιος ἱρή.</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Chapman makes this:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>And such a <i>stormy</i> day shall come, in mind and soul I know,</div>
      <div class='line'>When sacred Troy <i>shall shed her towers, for tears of overthrow</i>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>I might go on for ever, but I could not give
you a better illustration than this last, of
what I mean by saying that the Elizabethan
poet fails to render Homer because he cannot
forbear to interpose a play of thought
between his object and its expression.
Chapman translates his object into Elizabethan,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>as Pope translates it into the
Augustan of Queen Anne; both convey it
to us through a medium. Homer, on the
other hand, sees his object and conveys it
to us immediately.</p>

<p class='c005'>And yet, in spite of this perfect plainness
and directness of Homer’s style, in spite of
this perfect plainness and directness of his
ideas, he is eminently <i>noble</i>; he works as
entirely in the grand style, he is as grandiose,
as Phidias, or Dante, or Michael Angelo.
This is what makes his translators despair.
‘To give relief’, says Cowper, ‘to prosaic
subjects’ (such as dressing, eating, drinking,
harnessing, travelling, going to bed), that
is to treat such subjects nobly, in the grand
style, ‘without seeming unreasonably tumid,
is extremely difficult’. It <i>is</i> difficult, but
Homer has done it. Homer is precisely
the incomparable poet he is, because he
has done it. His translator must not be
tumid, must not be artificial, must not be
literary; true: but then also he must not
be commonplace, must not be ignoble. I
have shown you how translators of Homer
fail by wanting rapidity, by wanting simplicity
of style, by wanting plainness of
thought: in a second lecture I will show
you how a translator fails by wanting
nobility.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>
  <h2 id='part2' class='c003'><abbr title='2'>II</abbr></h2>
</div>
<p class='c004'>I must repeat what I said in beginning,
that the translator of Homer ought steadily
to keep in mind where lies the real test of
the success of his translation, what judges
he is to try to satisfy. He is to try to
satisfy <i>scholars</i>, because scholars alone have
the means of really judging him. A scholar
may be a pedant, it is true, and then his
judgment will be worthless; but a scholar
may also have poetical feeling, and then he
can judge him truly; whereas all the poetical
feeling in the world will not enable a
man who is not a scholar to judge him truly.
For the translator is to reproduce Homer,
and the scholar alone has the means of
knowing that Homer who is to be reproduced.
He knows him but imperfectly,
for he is separated from him by time, race,
and language; but he alone knows him
at all. Yet people speak as if there were
two real tribunals in this matter,—the
scholar’s tribunal, and that of the general
public. They speak as if the scholar’s
judgment was one thing, and the general
public’s judgment another; both with
their shortcomings, both with their liability
to error; but both to be regarded by the
translator. The translator who makes
verbal literalness his chief care ‘will’,
says a writer in the <i>National Review</i> whom
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>I have already quoted, ‘be appreciated by
the scholar accustomed to test a translation
rigidly by comparison with the original,
to look perhaps with excessive care to finish
in detail rather than boldness and general
effect, and find pardon even for a version
that seems bare and bold, so it be scholastic
and faithful’. But, if the scholar in
judging a translation looks to detail rather
than to general effect, he judges it pedantically
and ill. The appeal, however, lies
not from the pedantic scholar to the general
public, which can only like or dislike Chapman’s
version, or Pope’s, or Mr Newman’s,
but cannot <i>judge</i> them; it lies from the
pedantic scholar to the scholar who is not
pedantic, who knows that Homer is Homer
by his general effect, and not by his single
words, and who demands but one thing in
a translation,—that it shall, as nearly as
possible, reproduce for him the <i>general effect</i>
of Homer. This, then, remains the one
proper aim of the translator: to reproduce
on the intelligent scholar, as nearly as possible,
the general effect of Homer. Except
so far as he reproduces this, he loses his
labour, even though he may make a spirited
<i>Iliad</i> of his own, like Pope, or translate
Homer’s <i>Iliad</i> word for word, like Mr Newman.
If his proper aim were to stimulate
in any manner possible the general public,
he might be right in following Pope’s example;
if his proper aim were to help
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>schoolboys to construe Homer, he might
be right in following Mr Newman’s. But
it is not: his proper aim is, I repeat it yet
once more, to reproduce on the intelligent
scholar, as nearly as he can, the general
effect of Homer.</p>

<p class='c005'>When, therefore, Cowper says, ‘My chief
boast is that I have adhered closely to my
original’; when Mr Newman says, ‘My
aim is to retain every peculiarity of the
original, to be <i>faithful</i>, exactly as is the
case with the draughtsman of the Elgin
marbles’; their real judge only replies:
‘It may be so: reproduce then upon us,
reproduce the effect of Homer, as a good
copy reproduces the effect of the Elgin
marbles’.</p>

<p class='c005'>When, again, Mr Newman tells us that
‘by an exhaustive process of argument and
experiment’ he has found a metre which
is at once the metre of ‘the modern Greek
epic’, and a metre ‘like in moral genius’
to Homer’s metre, his judge has still but
the same answer for him: ‘It may be so:
reproduce then on our ear something of the
effect produced by the movement of Homer’.</p>

<p class='c005'>But what is the general effect which
Homer produces on Mr Newman himself?
because, when we know this, we shall know
whether he and his judges are agreed at
the outset, whether we may expect him,
if he can reproduce the effect he feels, if
his hand does not betray him in the execution,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>to satisfy his judges and to succeed.
If, however, Mr Newman’s impression from
Homer is something quite different from
that of his judges, then it can hardly be
expected that any amount of labour or
talent will enable him to reproduce for them
<i>their</i> Homer.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mr Newman does not leave us in doubt
as to the general effect which Homer makes
upon him. As I have told you what is the
general effect which Homer makes upon
me,—that of a most rapidly moving poet,
that of a poet most plain and direct in his
style, that of a poet most plain and direct
in his ideas, that of a poet eminently noble,—so
Mr Newman tells us his general impression
of Homer. ‘Homer’s style’, he says, ‘is
direct, popular, forcible, quaint, flowing,
garrulous’. Again: ‘Homer rises and
sinks with his subject, is prosaic when it
is tame, is low when it is mean’.</p>

<p class='c005'>I lay my finger on four words in these
two sentences of Mr Newman, and I say
that the man who could apply those words
to Homer can never render Homer truly.
The four words are these: <i>quaint</i>, <i>garrulous</i>,
<i>prosaic</i>, <i>low</i>. Search the English language
for a word which does not apply to Homer,
and you could not fix on a better than
<i>quaint</i>, unless perhaps you fixed on one
of the other three.</p>

<p class='c005'>Again; ‘to translate Homer suitably’,
says Mr Newman, ‘we need a diction sufficiently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>antiquated to obtain pardon of the
reader for its frequent homeliness’. ‘I
am concerned’, he says again, ‘with the
artistic problem of attaining a plausible
aspect of moderate antiquity, while remaining
easily intelligible’. And again, he
speaks of ‘the more antiquated style suited
to this subject’. Quaint! antiquated!—but
to whom? Sir Thomas Browne is
quaint, and the diction of Chaucer is antiquated:
does Mr Newman suppose that
Homer seemed quaint to Sophocles, when
he read him, as Sir Thomas Browne seems
quaint to us, when we read him? or that
Homer’s diction seemed antiquated to Sophocles,
as Chaucer’s diction seems antiquated
to us? But we cannot really know,
I confess, how Homer seemed to Sophocles:
well then, to those who can tell us how he
seems to them, to the living scholar, to our
only present witness on this matter,—does
Homer make on the Provost of Eton, when
he reads him, the impression of a poet
quaint and antiquated? does he make this
impression on Professor Thompson or Professor
Jowett. When Shakspeare says,
‘The princes <i>orgulous</i>’, meaning ‘the proud
princes’, we say, ‘This is antiquated’;
when he says of the Trojan gates, that they</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in14'>With massy staples</div>
      <div class='line'>And corresponsive and fulfilling bolts</div>
      <div class='line'><i>Sperr</i> up the sons of Troy,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>we say, ‘This is both quaint and antiquated’.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>But does Homer ever compose
in a language which produces on the scholar
at all the same impression as this language
which I have quoted from Shakspeare?
Never once. Shakspeare is quaint and antiquated
in the lines which I have just quoted;
but Shakspeare—need I say it?—can compose,
when he likes, when he is at his best,
in a language perfectly simple, perfectly
intelligible; in a language which, in spite
of the two centuries and a half which part
its author from us, stops us or surprises us
as little as the language of a contemporary.
And Homer has not Shakspeare’s variations:
Homer always composes as Shakspeare
composes at his best; Homer is always
simple and intelligible, as Shakspeare is
often; Homer is never quaint and antiquated,
as Shakspeare is sometimes.</p>

<p class='c005'>When Mr Newman says that Homer is
garrulous, he seems, perhaps, to depart less
widely from the common opinion than when
he calls him quaint; for is there not Horace’s
authority for asserting that ‘the good
Homer sometimes nods’, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>bonus dormitat
Homerus</i></span>? and a great many people have
come, from the currency of this well-known
criticism, to represent Homer to themselves
as a diffuse old man, with the full-stocked
mind, but also with the occasional slips and
weaknesses of old age. Horace has said
better things than his <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘bonus dormitat
Homerus’</span>; but he never meant by this,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>as I need not remind anyone who knows
the passage, that Homer was garrulous, or
anything of the kind. Instead, however,
of either discussing what Horace meant, or
discussing Homer’s garrulity as a general
question, I prefer to bring to my mind some
style which is garrulous, and to ask myself,
to ask you, whether anything at all of the
impression made by that style is ever made
by the style of Homer. The mediæval romancers,
for instance, are garrulous; the
following, to take out of a thousand instances
the first which comes to hand, is
in a garrulous manner. It is from the
romance of Richard Cœur de Lion.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Of my tale be not a-wondered!</div>
      <div class='line'>The French says he slew an hundred</div>
      <div class='line'>(Whereof is made this English saw)</div>
      <div class='line'>Or he rested him any thraw.</div>
      <div class='line'>Him followed many an English knight</div>
      <div class='line'>That eagerly holp him for to fight</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>and so on. Now the manner of that composition
I call garrulous; everyone will
feel it to be garrulous; everyone will understand
what is meant when it is called garrulous.
Then I ask the scholar,—does
Homer’s manner ever make upon you, I
do not say, the same impression of its
garrulity as that passage, but does it make,
ever for one moment, an impression in the
slightest way resembling, in the remotest
degree akin to, the impression made by
that passage of the mediæval poet? I have
no fear of the answer.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>I follow the same method with Mr Newman’s
two other epithets, <i>prosaic</i> and <i>low</i>.
‘Homer rises and sinks with his subject’,
says Mr Newman; ‘is prosaic when it is
tame, is low when it is mean’. First I say,
Homer is never, in any sense, to be with
truth called prosaic; he is never to be
called low. He does not rise and sink with
his subject; on the contrary, his manner
invests his subject, whatever his subject
be, with nobleness. Then I look for an
author of whom it may with truth be said,
that he ‘rises and sinks with his subject,
is prosaic when it is tame, is low when it is
mean’. Defoe is eminently such an author;
of Defoe’s manner it may with perfect precision
be said, that it follows his matter;
his lifelike composition takes its character
from the facts which it conveys, not from
the nobleness of the composer. In <i>Moll
Flanders</i> and <i>Colonel Jack</i>, Defoe is undoubtedly
prosaic when his subject is tame,
low when his subject is mean. Does
Homer’s manner in the <i>Iliad</i>, I ask the
scholar, ever make upon him an impression
at all like the impression made by Defoe’s
manner in <i>Moll Flanders</i> and <i>Colonel Jack</i>?
Does it not, on the contrary, leave him with
an impression of nobleness, even when it
deals with Thersites or with Irus?</p>

<p class='c005'>Well then, Homer is neither quaint, nor
garrulous, nor prosaic, nor mean: and Mr
Newman, in seeing him so, sees him differently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>from those who are to judge Mr Newman’s
rendering of him. By pointing out
how a wrong conception of Homer affects
Mr Newman’s translation, I hope to place
in still clearer light those four cardinal
truths which I pronounce essential for him
who would have a right conception of
Homer: that Homer is rapid, that he is
plain and direct in word and style, that he
is plain and direct in his ideas, and that he
is noble.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mr Newman says that in fixing on a style
for suitably rendering Homer, as he conceives
him, he ‘alights on the delicate line
which separates the <i>quaint</i> from the <i>grotesque</i>’.
‘I ought to be quaint’, he says,
‘I ought not to be grotesque’. This is a
most unfortunate sentence. Mr Newman
is grotesque, which he himself says he
ought not to be; and he ought not to be
quaint, which he himself says he ought to
be.</p>

<p class='c005'>‘No two persons will agree’, says Mr
Newman, ‘as to where the quaint ends
and the grotesque begins’; and perhaps
this is true. But, in order to avoid all ambiguity
in the use of the two words, it is
enough to say, that most persons would
call an expression which produced on them
a very strong sense of its incongruity, and
which violently surprised them, <i>grotesque</i>;
and an expression, which produced on them
a slighter sense of its incongruity, and which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>more gently surprised them, <i>quaint</i>. Using
the two words in this manner, I say, that
when Mr Newman translates Helen’s words
to Hector in the sixth book,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Δᾶερ ἐμεῖο, κυνὸς κακομηχάνου, ὀκρυοέσσης</span><a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c009'><sup>[10]</sup></a>,</div>

    <div class='group'>

      <div class='line'>A numbing horror,</div>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>he is grotesque; that is, he expresses himself
in a manner which produces on us a
very strong sense of its incongruity, and
which violently surprises us. I say, again,
that when Mr Newman translates the common
line,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Τὴν δ’ ἠμείβετ’ ἔπειτα μέγας κορυθαίολος Ἕκτωρ,</span></div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Great Hector of the motley helm then spake to her responsive,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>or the common expression, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐϋκνήμιδες Ἀχαιοί</span>,
‘dapper-greaved Achaians’, he is quaint;
that is, he expresses himself in a manner
which produces on us a slighter sense of
incongruity, and which more gently surprises
us. But violent and gentle surprise
are alike far from the scholar’s spirit when
he reads in Homer <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κυνὸς κακομηχάνου</span>, or
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κορυθαίολος Ἕκτωρ</span>, or, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐϋκνήμιδες Ἀχαιοί</span>.
These expressions no more seem odd to
him than the simplest expressions in English.
He is not more checked by any feeling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>of strangeness, strong or weak, when he
reads them, than when he reads in an
English book ‘the painted savage’, or,
‘the phlegmatic Dutchman’. Mr Newman’s
renderings of them must, therefore,
be wrong expressions in a translation of
Homer, because they excite in the scholar,
their only competent judge, a feeling quite
alien to that excited in him by what they
profess to render.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mr Newman, by expressions of this kind,
is false to his original in two ways. He is
false to him inasmuch as he is ignoble; for
a noble air, and a grotesque air, the air of
the address,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Δᾶερ ἐμεῖο, κυνὸς κακομηχάνου, ὀκρυοέσσης,</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>and the air of the address,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>O, brother thou of me, who am a mischief-working vixen,</div>
      <div class='line'>A numbing horror,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>are just contrary the one to the other:
and he is false to him inasmuch as he is
odd; for an odd diction like Mr Newman’s,
and a perfectly plain natural diction like
Homer’s,—‘dapper-greaved Achaians’ and
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐϋκνήμιδες Ἀχαιοί</span>,—are also just contrary
the one to the other. Where, indeed,
Mr Newman got his diction, with whom he
can have lived, what can be his test of antiquity
and rarity for words, are questions
which I ask myself with bewilderment. He
has prefixed to his translation a list of what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>he calls ‘the more antiquated or rarer
words’ which he has used. In this list
appear, on the one hand, such words as
<i>doughty</i>, <i>grisly</i>, <i>lusty</i>, <i>noisome</i>, <i>ravin</i>, which
are familiar, one would think, to all the
world; on the other hand such words as
<i>bragly</i>, meaning, Mr Newman tells us,
‘proudly fine’; <i>bulkin</i>, ‘a calf’; <i>plump</i>,
a ‘mass’; and so on. ‘I am concerned’,
says Mr Newman, ‘with the artistic problem
of attaining a plausible aspect of
moderate antiquity, while remaining easily
intelligible’. But it seems to me that <i>lusty</i>
is not antiquated: and that <i>bragly</i> is not a
word readily understood. That this word,
indeed, and <i>bulkin</i>, may have ‘a plausible
aspect of moderate antiquity’, I admit;
but that they are ‘easily intelligible’, I
deny.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mr Newman’s syntax has, I say it with
pleasure, a much more Homeric cast than
his vocabulary; his syntax, the mode in
which his thought is evolved, although not
the actual words in which it is expressed,
seems to me right in its general character,
and the best feature of his version. It is
not artificial or rhetorical like Cowper’s
syntax or Pope’s: it is simple, direct, and
natural, and so far it is like Homer’s. It
fails, however, just where, from the inherent
fault of Mr Newman’s conception of Homer,
one might expect it to fail,—it fails in nobleness.
It presents the thought in a way
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>which is something more than unconstrained,—over-familiar;
something more than easy,—free
and easy. In this respect it is like
the movement of Mr Newman’s version,
like his rhythm, for this, too, fails, in spite
of some qualities, by not being noble enough;
this, while it avoids the faults of being slow
and elaborate, falls into a fault in the opposite
direction, and is slip-shod. Homer
presents his thought naturally; but when
Mr Newman has,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>A thousand fires along the plain, <i>I say</i>, that night were burning,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>he presents his thought familiarly; in a
style which may be the genuine style of
ballad-poetry, but which is not the style
of Homer. Homer moves freely; but
when Mr Newman has,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Infatuate! O that thou wert lord to some other army<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c009'><sup>[11]</sup></a>,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>he gives himself too much freedom; he
leaves us too much to do for his rhythm
ourselves, instead of giving to us a rhythm
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>like Homer’s, easy indeed, but mastering
our ear with a fulness of power which is
irresistible.</p>

<p class='c005'>I said that a certain style might be the
genuine style of ballad-poetry, but yet not
the style of Homer. The analogy of the
ballad is ever present to Mr Newman’s
thoughts in considering Homer; and perhaps
nothing has more caused his faults
than this analogy,—this popular, but, it is
time to say, this erroneous analogy. ‘The
moral qualities of Homer’s style’, says Mr
Newman, ‘being like to those of the English
ballad, we need a metre of the same genius.
Only those metres, which by the very possession
of these qualities are liable to degenerate
into <i>doggerel</i>, are suitable to
reproduce the ancient epic’. ‘The style of
Homer’, he says, in a passage which I have
before quoted, ‘is direct, popular, forcible,
quaint, flowing, garrulous: in all these respects
it is similar to the old English ballad’.
Mr Newman, I need not say, is by no means
alone in this opinion. ‘The most really
and truly Homeric of all the creations of
the English muse is’, says Mr Newman’s
critic in the <i>National Review</i>, ‘the ballad-poetry
of ancient times; and the association
between metre and subject is one that
it would be true wisdom to preserve’. ‘It
is confessed’, says Chapman’s last editor,
Mr Hooper, ‘that the fourteen-syllable
verse’ (that is, a ballad-verse) ‘is peculiarly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>fitting for Homeric translation’. And the
editor of Dr Maginn’s clever and popular
<i>Homeric Ballads</i> assumes it as one of his
author’s greatest and most undisputable
merits, that he was ‘the first who consciously
realised to himself the truth that Greek
ballads can be really represented in English
only by a similar measure’.</p>

<p class='c005'>This proposition that Homer’s poetry is
<i>ballad-poetry</i>, analogous to the well-known
ballad-poetry of the English and other
nations, has a certain small portion of truth
in it, and at one time probably served a
useful purpose, when it was employed to
discredit the artificial and literary manner
in which Pope and his school rendered
Homer. But it has been so extravagantly
over-used, the mistake which it was useful
in combating has so entirely lost the public
favour, that it is now much more important
to insist on the large part of error contained
in it, than to extol its small part of truth.
It is time to say plainly that, whatever the
admirers of our old ballads may think, the
supreme form of epic poetry, the genuine
Homeric mould, is not the form of the
Ballad of Lord Bateman. I have myself
shown the broad difference between Milton’s
manner and Homer’s; but, after a course
of Mr Newman and Dr Maginn, I turn
round in desperation upon them and upon
the balladists who have misled them, and
I exclaim: ‘Compared with you, Milton
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>is Homer’s double; there is, whatever you
may think, ten thousand times more of the
real strain of Homer in</p>

</div>

<p class='c008'>For Homer is not only rapid in movement,
simple in style, plain in language, natural
in thought; he is also, and above all, <i>noble</i>.
I have advised the translator not to go into
the vexed question of Homer’s identity.
Yet I will just remind him that the grand
argument—or rather, not argument, for
the matter affords no data for arguing, but
the grand source from which conviction,
as we read the <i>Iliad</i>, keeps pressing in upon
us, that there is one poet of the <i>Iliad</i>, one
Homer—is precisely this nobleness of the
poet, this grand manner; we feel that the
analogy drawn from other joint compositions
does not hold good here, because those
works do not bear, like the <i>Iliad</i>, the magic
stamp of a master; and the moment you
have <i>anything</i> less than a masterwork, the
co-operation or consolidation of several poets
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>becomes possible, for talent is not uncommon;
the moment you have <i>much</i> less than
a masterwork, they become easy, for mediocrity
is everywhere. I can imagine fifty
Bradies joined with as many Tates to make
the New Version of the Psalms. I can
imagine several poets having contributed
to any one of the old English ballads in
Percy’s collection. I can imagine several
poets, possessing, like Chapman, the Elizabethan
vigour and the Elizabethan mannerism,
united with Chapman to produce
his version of the <i>Iliad</i>. I can imagine
several poets, with the literary knack of the
twelfth century, united to produce the
<i>Nibelungen Lay</i> in the form in which we
have it,—a work which the Germans, in
their joy at discovering a national epic of
their own, have rated vastly higher than
it deserves. And lastly, though Mr Newman’s
translation of Homer bears the strong
mark of his own idiosyncrasy, yet I can
imagine Mr Newman and a school of adepts
trained by him in his art of poetry, jointly
producing that work, so that Aristarchus
himself should have difficulty in pronouncing
which line was the master’s, and which a
pupil’s. But I cannot imagine several poets,
or one poet, joined with Dante in the composition
of his <i>Inferno</i>, though many poets
have taken for their subject a descent into
Hell. Many artists, again, have represented
Moses; but there is only one Moses
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>of Michael Angelo. So the insurmountable
obstacle to believing the <i>Iliad</i> a consolidated
work of several poets is this: that the work
of great masters is unique; and the <i>Iliad</i>
has a great master’s genuine stamp, and that
stamp is <i>the grand style</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>Poets who cannot work in the grand style
instinctively seek a style in which their
comparative inferiority may feel itself at
ease, a manner which may be, so to speak,
indulgent to their inequalities. The ballad-style
offers to an epic poet, quite unable to
fill the canvas of Homer, or Dante, or Milton,
a canvas which he is capable of filling. The
ballad-measure is quite able to give due
effect to the vigour and spirit which its
employer, when at his very best, may be
able to exhibit; and, when he is not at his
best, when he is a little trivial, or a little
dull, it will not betray him, it will not bring
out his weakness into broad relief. This
is a convenience; but it is a convenience
which the ballad-style purchases by resigning
all pretensions to the highest, to
the grand manner. It is true of its movement,
as it is <i>not</i> true of Homer’s, that it
is ‘liable to degenerate into doggerel’. It
is true of its ‘moral qualities’, as it is <i>not</i>
true of Homer’s, that ‘quaintness’ and
‘garrulity’ are among them. It is true of
its employers, as it is <i>not</i> true of Homer,
that they ‘rise and sink with their subject,
are prosaic when it is tame, are low when it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>is mean’. For this reason the ballad-style
and the ballad-measure are eminently <i>in</i>appropriate
to render Homer. Homer’s
manner and movement are always both
noble and powerful: the ballad-manner
and movement are often either jaunty and
smart, so not noble; or jog-trot and hum-drum,
so not powerful.</p>

<p class='c005'>The <i>Nibelungen Lay</i> affords a good illustration
of the qualities of the ballad-manner.
Based on grand traditions, which had found
expression in a grand lyric poetry, the
German epic poem of the <i>Nibelungen Lay</i>,
though it is interesting, and though it has
good passages, is itself anything rather than
a grand poem. It is a poem of which the
composer is, to speak the truth, a very
ordinary mortal, and often, therefore, like
other ordinary mortals, very prosy. It is in
a measure which eminently adapts itself to
this commonplace personality of its composer,
which has much the movement of
the well-known measures of Tate and Brady,
and can jog on, for hundreds of lines at a
time, with a level ease which reminds one
of Sheridan’s saying that easy writing may
be often such hard reading. But, instead of
occupying myself with the <i>Nibelungen Lay</i>,
I prefer to look at the ballad-style as directly
applied to Homer, in Chapman’s version and
Mr Newman’s, and in the <i>Homeric Ballads</i>
of Dr. Maginn.</p>

<p class='c005'>First I take Chapman. I have already
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>shown that Chapman’s conceits are un-Homeric,
and that his rhyme is un-Homeric;
I will now show how his manner and movement
are un-Homeric. Chapman’s diction,
I have said, is generally good; but it must
be called good with this reserve, that,
though it has Homer’s plainness and directness,
it often offends him who knows Homer,
by wanting Homer’s nobleness. In a passage
which I have already quoted, the address
of Zeus to the horses of Achilles, where
Homer has,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Chapman has,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in18'><i>Poor wretched beasts</i>, said he,</div>
      <div class='line'>Why gave we you to a mortal king, when immortality</div>
      <div class='line'>And incapacity of age so dignifies your states?</div>
      <div class='line'>Was it to haste<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c009'><sup>[15]</sup></a> the miseries poured out on human fates?</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>There are many faults in this rendering of
Chapman’s, but what I particularly wish
to notice in it is the expression ‘Poor
wretched beasts’ for <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἆ δειλώ</span>. This expression
just illustrates the difference between
the ballad-manner and Homer’s.
The ballad-manner—Chapman’s manner—is,
I say, pitched sensibly lower than
Homer’s. The ballad-manner requires that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>an expression shall be plain and natural,
and then it asks no more. Homer’s manner
requires that an expression shall be plain
and natural, but it also requires that it
shall be noble. <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἆ δειλώ</span> is as plain, as
simple as ‘Poor wretched beasts’; but it
is also noble, which ‘Poor wretched beasts’
is not. ‘Poor wretched beasts’ is, in truth,
a little over-familiar, but this is no objection
to it for the ballad-manner; it is good
enough for the old English ballad, good
enough for the <i>Nibelungen Lay</i>, good enough
for Chapman’s <i>Iliad</i>, good enough for Mr
Newman’s <i>Iliad</i>, good enough for Dr
Maginn’s <i>Homeric Ballads</i>; but it is not
good enough for Homer.</p>

<p class='c005'>To feel that Chapman’s measure, though
natural, is not Homeric; that, though
tolerably rapid, it has not Homer’s rapidity;
that it has a jogging rapidity rather than a
flowing rapidity; and a movement familiar
rather than nobly easy, one has only, I
think, to read half a dozen lines in any
part of his version. I prefer to keep as
much as possible to passages which I have
already noticed, so I will quote the conclusion
of the nineteenth book, where
Achilles answers his horse Xanthus, who
has prophesied his death to him<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c009'><sup>[16]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in22'>Achilles, far in rage,</div>
      <div class='line'>Thus answered him:—It fits not thee thus proudly to presage</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>My overthrow. I know myself it is my fate to fall</div>
      <div class='line'>Thus far from Phthia; yet that fate shall fail to vent her gall</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>For what regards the manner of this passage,
the words ‘Achilles Thus answered him’,
and  ‘I know myself it is my fate to fall
Thus far from Phthia’, are in Homer’s
manner, and all the rest is out of it. But
for what regards its movement, who, after
being jolted by Chapman through such
verse as this,</p>

<p class='c008'>who does not feel the vital difference of
the movement of Homer,</p>

</div>

<p class='c008'>To pass from Chapman to Dr Maginn.
His <i>Homeric Ballads</i> are vigorous and
genuine poems in their own way; they are
not one continual falsetto, like the pinch-beck
<i>Roman Ballads</i> of Lord Macaulay;
but just because they are ballads in their
manner and movement, just because, to
use the words of his applauding editor, Dr
Maginn has ‘consciously realised to himself
the truth that Greek ballads can be really
represented in English only by a similar
manner’,—just for this very reason they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>are not at all Homeric, they have not the
least in the world the manner of Homer.
There is a celebrated incident in the nineteenth
book of the <i>Odyssey</i>, the recognition
by the old nurse Eurycleia of a scar on the
leg of her master Ulysses, who has entered
his own hall as an unknown wanderer, and
whose feet she has been set to wash. ‘Then
she came near’, says Homer, ‘and began
to wash her master; and straightway she
recognised a scar which he had got in
former days from the white tusk of a wild
boar, when he went to Parnassus unto
Autolycus and the sons of Autolycus, his
mother’s father and brethren’<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c009'><sup>[17]</sup></a>. This,
‘really represented’ by Dr Maginn, in ‘a
measure similar’ to Homer’s, becomes:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>And scarcely had she begun to wash</div>
      <div class='line'>Ere she was aware of the grisly gash</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Above his knee that lay.</div>
      <div class='line'>It was a wound from a wild boar’s tooth,</div>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>and so on. That is the true ballad-manner,
no one can deny; ‘all on Parnassus’ slope’
is, I was going to say, the true ballad-slang;
but never again shall I be able to read</p>

<p class='c008'>jigging in my ears, to spoil the effect of
Homer, and to torture me. To apply that
manner and that rhythm to Homer’s incidents,
is not to imitate Homer, but to
travesty him.</p>

<p class='c005'>Lastly I come to Mr Newman. His
rhythm, like Chapman’s and Dr Maginn’s,
is a ballad-rhythm, but with a modification
of his own. ‘Holding it’, he tells us, ‘as
an axiom, that rhyme must be abandoned’,
he found, on abandoning it, ‘an unpleasant
void until he gave a double ending to the
verse’. In short, instead of saying</p>

      <div class='line'>Good people all with one accord</div>
      <div class='line'>Give ear unto my <i>tale</i>,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Mr Newman would say</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Good people all with one accord</div>
      <div class='line'>Give ear unto my <i>story</i>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>A recent American writer<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c009'><sup>[18]</sup></a> gravely observes
that for his countrymen this rhythm has a
disadvantage in being like the rhythm of
the American national air <i>Yankee Doodle</i>,
and thus provoking ludicrous associations.
<i>Yankee Doodle</i> is not our national air: for
us Mr Newman’s rhythm has not this disadvantage.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>He himself gives us several
plausible reasons why this rhythm of his
really ought to be successful: let us examine
how far it <i>is</i> successful.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mr Newman joins to a bad rhythm so
bad a diction that it is difficult to distinguish
exactly whether in any given passage it is
his words or his measure which produces a
total impression of such an unpleasant kind.
But with a little attention we may analyse
our total impression, and find the share
which each element has in producing it.
To take the passage which I have so often
mentioned, Sarpedon’s speech to Glaucus.
Mr Newman translates this as follows:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>O gentle friend! if thou and I, from this encounter ’scaping,</div>
      <div class='line'>Hereafter might for ever be from Eld and Death exempted</div>
      <div class='line'>As heavenly gods, not I in sooth would fight among the foremost,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor liefly thee would I advance to man-ennobling battle.</div>
      <div class='line'>Now,—sith ten thousand shapes of Death do any-gait pursue us</div>
      <div class='line'>Which never mortal may evade, though sly of foot and nimble;—</div>
      <div class='line'>Onward! and glory let us earn, or glory yield to someone.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Could all our care elude the gloomy grave</div>
      <div class='line'>Which claims no less the fearful than the brave.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>I am not going to quote Pope’s version over
again, but I must remark in passing, how
much more, with all Pope’s radical difference
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>of manner from Homer, it gives us of the
real effect of</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">εἰ μὲν γὰρ, πόλεμον περὶ τόνδε φυγόντε</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>than Mr Newman’s lines. And now, why
are Mr Newman’s lines faulty? They are
faulty, first, because, as a matter of diction,
the expressions ‘O gentle friend’, ‘eld’,
‘in sooth’, ‘liefly’, ‘advance’, ‘man-ennobling’,
‘sith’, ‘any-gait’, and ‘sly of
foot’, are all bad; some of them worse
than others, but all bad: that is, they all
of them as here used excite in the scholar,
their sole judge,—excite, I will boldly affirm,
in Professor Thompson or Professor Jowett,—a
feeling totally different from that excited
in them by the words of Homer which
these expressions profess to render. The
lines are faulty, secondly, because, as a
matter of rhythm, any and every line among
them has to the ear of the same judges (I
affirm it with equal boldness) a movement
as unlike Homer’s movement in the corresponding
line as the single words are unlike
Homer’s words. <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Οὔτε κέ σε στέλλοιμαι μάχην
ἐς κυδιάνειρν</span>,—‘Nor liefly thee would I advance
to man-ennobling battle’;—for
whose ears do those two rhythms produce
impressions of, to use Mr Newman’s own
words, ‘similar moral genius’?</p>

<p class='c005'>I will by no means make search in Mr
Newman’s version for passages likely to
raise a laugh; that search, alas! would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>be far too easy. I will quote but one other
passage from him, and that a passage where
the diction is comparatively inoffensive, in
order that disapproval of the words may not
unfairly heighten disapproval of the rhythm.
The end of the nineteenth book, the answer
of Achilles to his horse Xanthus, Mr Newman
gives thus:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Chestnut! why bodest death to me? from thee this was not needed.</div>
      <div class='line'>Myself right surely know alsó, that ’t is my doom to perish,</div>
      <div class='line'>From mother and from father dear apart, in Troy; but never</div>
      <div class='line'>Pause will I make of war, until the Trojans be glutted.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>He spake, and yelling, held afront the single-hoofed horses.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Here Mr Newman calls Xanthus <i>Chestnut</i>,
indeed, as he calls Balius <i>Spotted</i>, and
Podarga <i>Spry-foot</i>; which is as if a Frenchman
were to call Miss Nightingale <i>Mdlle.
Rossignol</i>, or Mr Bright <i>M. Clair</i>. And
several other expressions, too, ‘yelling’,
‘held afront’, ‘single-hoofed’,—leave, to
say the very least, much to be desired. Still,
for Mr Newman, the diction of this passage
is pure. All the more clearly appears the
profound vice of a rhythm, which, with
comparatively few faults of words, can leave
a sense of such incurable alienation from
Homer’s manner as, ‘Myself right surely
know also that ’tis my doom to perish
compared with the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">εὖ νύ τοι οἶδα καὶ αὐτὸς,
ὅ μοι μόρος ἐνθάδ’ ὀλέσθαι</span> of Homer.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>But so deeply seated is the difference between
the ballad-manner and Homer’s, that
even a man of the highest powers, even a
man of the greatest vigour of spirit and of
true genius—the Coryphæus of balladists,
Sir Walter Scott—fails with a manner of
this kind to produce an effect at all like the
effect of Homer. ‘I am not so rash’, declares
Mr Newman, ‘as to say that if <i>freedom</i>
be given to rhyme as in Walter Scott’s
poetry’,—‘Walter Scott, by far the most
Homeric of our poets’, as in another place
he calls him,—‘a genius may not arise who
will translate Homer into the melodies of
<i>Marmion</i>’. ‘The <i>truly</i> classical and <i>truly</i>
romantic’, says Dr Maginn, ‘are one;
the moss-trooping Nestor reappears in the
moss-trooping heroes of Percy’s <i>Reliques</i>’;
and a description by Scott, which he quotes,
he calls ‘graphic, and therefore Homeric’.
He forgets our fourth axiom,—that Homer
is not <i>only</i> graphic; he is also noble, and
has the grand style. Human nature under
like circumstances is probably in all stages
much the same; and so far it may be said
that ‘the truly classical and the truly romantic
are one’; but it is of little use to
tell us this, because we know the human
nature of other ages only through the representations
of them which have come
down to us, and the classical and the romantic
modes of representation are so far
from being ‘one’, that they remain eternally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>distinct, and have created for us a separation
between the two worlds which they respectively
represent. Therefore to call
Nestor the ‘moss-trooping Nestor’ is absurd,
because, though Nestor may possibly
have been much the same sort of man as
many a moss-trooper, he has yet come to
us through a mode of representation so
unlike that of Percy’s <i>Reliques</i>, that instead
of ‘reappearing in the moss-trooping heroes’
of these poems, he exists in our imagination
as something utterly unlike them, and as
belonging to another world. So the Greeks
in Shakspeare’s <i>Troilus and Cressida</i> are
no longer the Greeks whom we have known
in Homer, because they come to us through
a mode of representation of the romantic
world. But I must not forget Scott.</p>

<p class='c005'>I suppose that when Scott is in what
may be called full ballad swing, no one will
hesitate to pronounce his manner neither
Homeric nor the grand manner. When he
says, for instance,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>I do not rhyme to that dull elf</div>
      <div class='line'>Who cannot image to himself<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c009'><sup>[19]</sup></a>,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>and so on, any scholar will feel that <i>this</i> is
not Homer’s manner. But let us take
Scott’s poetry at its best; and when it is
at its best, it is undoubtedly very good
indeed:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Tunstall lies dead upon the field,</div>
      <div class='line'>His life-blood stains the spotless shield;</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>Edmund is down,—my life is reft,—</div>
      <div class='line'>The Admiral alone is left.</div>
      <div class='line'>Let Stanley charge with spur of fire,—</div>
      <div class='line'>With Chester charge, and Lancashire,</div>
      <div class='line'>Full upon Scotland’s central host,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or victory and England’s lost<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c009'><sup>[20]</sup></a>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>That is, no doubt, as vigorous as possible,
as spirited as possible; it is exceedingly
fine poetry. And still I say, it is not in
the grand manner, and therefore it is not
like Homer’s poetry. Now, how shall I
make him who doubts this feel that I say
true; that these lines of Scott are essentially
neither in Homer’s style nor in the grand
style? I may point out to him that the
movement of Scott’s lines, while it is rapid,
is also at the same time what the French
call <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>saccadé</i></span>, its rapidity is ‘jerky’; whereas
Homer’s rapidity is a flowing rapidity. But
this is something external and material;
it is but the outward and visible sign of an
inward and spiritual diversity. I may discuss
what, in the abstract, constitutes the
grand style; but that sort of general discussion
never much helps our judgment of
particular instances. I may say that the
presence or absence of the grand style can
only be spiritually discerned; and this is
true, but to plead this looks like evading
the difficulty. My best way is to take
eminent specimens of the grand style, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>to put them side by side with this of Scott.
For example, when Homer says:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">άλλά, φίλος, θάνε καὶ σύ· τίη ὀλυφύρεαι οὕτως;</span></div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>that is in the grand style. When Virgil
says:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Disce, puer, virtutem ex me verumque laborem,</span></div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>that is in the grand style. When Dante
says:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Lascio lo fele, et vo pei dolci pomi</span></div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>that is in the grand style. When Milton
says:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in14'>His form had yet not lost</div>
      <div class='line'>All her original brightness, nor appeared</div>
      <div class='line'>Less than archangel ruined, and the excess</div>
      <div class='line'>Of glory obscured<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c009'><sup>[24]</sup></a>,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>that, finally, is in the grand style. Now
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>let anyone after repeating to himself these
four passages, repeat again the passage of
Scott, and he will perceive that there is
something in style which the four first have
in common, and which the last is without;
and this something is precisely the grand
manner. It is no disrespect to Scott to say
that he does not attain to this manner in
his poetry; to say so, is merely to say that
he is not among the five or six supreme
poets of the world. Among these he is
not; but, being a man of far greater powers
than the ballad-poets, he has tried to give
to their instrument a compass and an elevation
which it does not naturally possess,
in order to enable him to come nearer to
the effect of the instrument used by the
great epic poets—an instrument which he
felt he could not truly use,—and in this
attempt he has but imperfectly succeeded.
The poetic style of Scott is—(it becomes
necessary to say so when it is proposed to
‘translate Homer into the melodies of
<i>Marmion</i>’)—it is, tried by the highest
standard, a bastard epic style; and that is
why, out of his own powerful hands, it has
had so little success. It is a less natural,
and therefore a less good style, than the
original ballad-style; while it shares with
the ballad-style the inherent incapacity of
rising into the grand style, of adequately
rendering Homer. Scott is certainly at his
best in his battles. Of Homer you could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>not say this; he is not better in his battles
than elsewhere; but even between the
battle-pieces of the two there exists all the
difference which there is between an able
work and a masterpiece.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Tunstall lies dead upon the field,</div>
      <div class='line'>His life-blood stains the spotless shield:</div>
      <div class='line'>Edmund is down,—my life is reft—</div>
      <div class='line'>The Admiral alone is left.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>—‘For not in the hands of Diomede the son
of Tydeus rages the spear, to ward off destruction
from the Danaans; neither as yet
have I heard the voice of the son of Atreus,
shouting out of his hated mouth; but the
voice of Hector the slayer of men bursts
round me, as he cheers on the Trojans;
and they with their yellings fill all the plain,
overcoming the Achaians in the battle’.—I
protest that, to my feeling, Homer’s performance,
even through that pale and far-off
shadow of a prose translation, still has
a hundred times more of the grand manner
about it, than the original poetry of Scott.</p>

<p class='c005'>Well, then, the ballad-manner and the
ballad-measure, whether in the hands of
the old ballad-poets, or arranged by Chapman,
or arranged by Mr Newman, or, even,
arranged by Sir Walter Scott, cannot
worthily render Homer. And for one
reason: Homer is plain, so are they;
Homer is natural, so are they; Homer is
spirited, so are they; but Homer is sustainedly
noble, and they are not. Homer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>and they are both of them natural, and
therefore touching and stirring; but the
grand style, which is Homer’s, is something
more than touching and stirring; it can
form the character, it is edifying. The old
English balladist may stir Sir Philip Sidney’s
heart like a trumpet, and this is much: but
Homer, but the few artists in the grand
style, can do more; they can refine the raw
natural man, they can transmute him. So
it is not without cause that I say, and say
again, to the translator of Homer: ‘Never
for a moment suffer yourself to forget our
fourth fundamental proposition, <i>Homer is
noble</i>’. For it is seen how large a share
this nobleness has in producing that general
effect of his, which it is the main business of
a translator to <i>re</i>produce.</p>

<p class='c005'>I shall have to try your patience yet once
more upon this subject, and then my task
will be completed. I have shown what the
four axioms respecting Homer which I have
laid down, exclude, what they bid a translator
not to do; I have still to show what
they supply, what positive help they can
give to the translator in his work. I will
even, with their aid, myself try my fortune
with some of those passages of Homer which
I have already noticed; not indeed with
any confidence that I more than others can
succeed in adequately rendering Homer, but
in the hope of satisfying competent judges,
in the hope of making it clear to the future
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>translator, that I at any rate follow a right
method, and that, in coming short, I come
short from weakness of execution, not from
original vice of design. This is why I have
so long occupied myself with Mr Newman’s
version; that, apart from all faults of execution,
his original design was wrong, and
that he has done us the good service of declaring
that design in its naked wrongness.
To bad practice he has prefixed the bad
theory which made the practice bad; he
has given us a false theory in his preface,
and he has exemplified the bad effects of
that false theory in his translation. It is
because his starting-point is so bad that he
runs so badly; and to save others from
taking so false a starting-point, may be to
save them from running so futile a course.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mr Newman, indeed, says in his preface,
that if anyone dislikes his translation, ‘he
has his easy remedy; to keep aloof from
it’. But Mr Newman is a writer of considerable
and deserved reputation; he is
also a Professor of the University of London,
an institution which by its position and by
its merits acquires every year greater importance.
It would be a very grave thing
if the authority of so eminent a Professor
led his students to misconceive entirely the
chief work of the Greek world; that work
which, whatever the other works of classical
antiquity have to give us, gives it more
abundantly than they all. The eccentricity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>too, the arbitrariness, of which Mr Newman’s
conception of Homer offers so signal
an example, are not a peculiar failing of
Mr Newman’s own; in varying degrees they
are the great defect of English intellect
the great blemish of English literature.
Our literature of the eighteenth century,
the literature of the school of Dryden,
Addison, Pope, Johnson, is a long reaction
against this eccentricity, this arbitrariness;
that reaction perished by its own faults,
and its enemies are left once more masters
of the field. It is much more likely that
any new English version of Homer will have
Mr Newman’s faults than Pope’s. Our
present literature, which is very far, certainly,
from having the spirit and power
of Elizabethan genius, yet has in its own
way these faults, eccentricity, and arbitrariness,
quite as much as the Elizabethan
literature ever had. They are the cause
that, while upon none, perhaps, of the
modern literatures has so great a sum of
force been expended as upon the English
literature, at the present hour this literature,
regarded not as an object of mere literary
interest but as a living intellectual instrument,
ranks only third in European effect and
importance among the literatures of Europe;
it ranks after the literatures of France and
Germany. Of these two literatures, as of
the intellect of Europe in general, the main
effort, for now many years, has been a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span><i>critical</i> effort; the endeavour, in all branches
of knowledge, theology, philosophy, history,
art, science,—to see the object as in itself it
really is. But, owing to the presence in
English literature of this eccentric and
arbitrary spirit, owing to the strong tendency
of English writers to bring to the consideration
of their object some individual fancy,
almost the last thing for which one would
come to English literature is just that very
thing which now Europe most desires—<i>criticism</i>.
It is useful to notice any signal
manifestation of those faults, which thus
limit and impair the action of our literature.
And therefore I have pointed out how widely,
in translating Homer, a man even of real
ability and learning may go astray, unless
he brings to the study of this clearest of
poets one quality in which our English
authors, with all their great gifts, are apt
to be somewhat wanting—simple lucidity
of mind.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='part3' class='c003'><abbr title='3'>III</abbr></h2>
</div>
<p class='c004'>Homer is rapid in his movement, Homer
is plain in his words and style, Homer is
simple in his ideas, Homer is noble in his
manner. Cowper renders him ill because
he is slow in his movement, and elaborate
in his style; Pope renders him ill because
he is artificial both in his style and in his
words; Chapman renders him ill because
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>he is fantastic in his ideas; Mr Newman
renders him ill because he is odd in his
words and ignoble in his manner. All four
translators diverge from their original at
other points besides those named; but it is
at the points thus named that their divergence
is greatest. For instance, Cowper’s
diction is not as Homer’s diction, nor his
nobleness as Homer’s nobleness; but it is
in movement and grammatical style that
he is most unlike Homer. Pope’s rapidity
is not of the same sort as Homer’s rapidity,
nor are his plainness of ideas and his nobleness
as Homer’s plainness of ideas and
nobleness: but it is in the artificial character
of his style and diction that he is
most unlike Homer. Chapman’s movement,
words, style, and manner, are often
far enough from resembling Homer’s movement,
words, style, and manner; but it is
the fantasticality of his ideas which puts
him farthest from resembling Homer. Mr
Newman’s movement, grammatical style,
and ideas, are a thousand times in strong
contrast with Homer’s; still it is by the
oddness of his diction and the ignobleness
of his manner that he contrasts with Homer
the most violently.</p>

<p class='c005'>Therefore the translator must not say to
himself: ‘Cowper is noble, Pope is rapid,
Chapman has a good diction, Mr Newman
has a good cast of sentence; I will avoid
Cowper’s slowness, Pope’s artificiality, Chapman’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>conceits, Mr Newman’s oddity; I
will take Cowper’s dignified manner, Pope’s
impetuous movement, Chapman’s vocabulary,
Mr Newman’s syntax, and so make
a perfect translation of Homer’. Undoubtedly
in certain points the versions
of Chapman, Cowper, Pope, and Mr Newman,
all of them have merit; some of them
very high merit, others a lower merit; but
even in these points they have none of them
precisely the same kind of merit as Homer,
and therefore the new translator, even if
he can imitate them in their good points,
will still not satisfy his judge, the scholar,
who asks him for Homer and Homer’s kind
of merit, or, at least, for as much of them
as it is possible to give.</p>

<p class='c005'>So the translator really has no good model
before him for any part of his work, and has
to invent everything for himself. He is
to be rapid in movement, plain in speech,
simple in thought, and noble; and <i>how</i> he
is to be either rapid, or plain, or simple, or
noble, no one yet has shown him. I shall
try to-day to establish some practical suggestions
which may help the translator of
Homer’s poetry to comply with the four
grand requirements which we make of him.</p>

<p class='c005'>His version is to be rapid; and of course,
to make a man’s poetry rapid, as to make
it noble, nothing can serve him so much as
to have, in his own nature, rapidity and
nobleness. <i>It is the spirit that quickeneth</i>;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>and no one will so well render Homer’s
swift-flowing movement as he who has himself
something of the swift-moving spirit of
Homer. Yet even this is not quite enough.
Pope certainly had a quick and darting
spirit, as he had, also, real nobleness; yet
Pope does not render the movement of
Homer. To render this the translator must
have, besides his natural qualifications, an
appropriate metre.</p>

<p class='c005'>I have sufficiently shown why I think
all forms of our ballad-metre unsuited to
Homer. It seems to me to be beyond
question that, for epic poetry, only three
metres can seriously claim to be accounted
capable of the grand style. Two of these
will at once occur to everyone,—the ten-syllable,
or so-called <i>heroic</i>, couplet, and
blank verse. I do not add to these the
Spenserian stanza, although Dr Maginn,
whose metrical eccentricities I have already
criticised, pronounces this stanza the one
right measure for a translation of Homer.
It is enough to observe that if Pope’s couplet,
with the simple system of correspondences
that its rhymes introduce, changes the movement
of Homer, in which no such correspondences
are found, and is therefore a
bad measure for a translator of Homer to
employ, Spenser’s stanza, with its far more
intricate system of correspondences, must
change Homer’s movement far more profoundly,
and must therefore be for the translator
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>a far worse measure than the couplet
of Pope. Yet I will say, at the same time,
that the verse of Spenser is more fluid, slips
more easily and quickly along, than the
verse of almost any other English poet.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>By this the northern wagoner had set</div>
      <div class='line'>His seven-fold team behind the steadfast star</div>
      <div class='line'>That was in ocean waves yet never wet,</div>
      <div class='line'>But firm is fixt, and sendeth light from far</div>
      <div class='line'>To all that in the wide deep wandering are<a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c009'><sup>[25]</sup></a>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>One cannot but feel that English verse has
not often moved with the fluidity and
sweet ease of these lines. It is possible
that it may have been this quality of
Spenser’s poetry which made Dr Maginn
think that the stanza of <i>The Faery Queen</i>
must be a good measure for rendering
Homer. This it is not: Spenser’s verse
is fluid and rapid, no doubt, but there are
more ways than one of being fluid and rapid,
and Homer is fluid and rapid in quite another
way than Spenser. Spenser’s manner is
no more Homeric than is the manner of
the one modern inheritor of Spenser’s
beautiful gift,—the poet, who evidently
caught from Spenser his sweet and easy-slipping
movement, and who has exquisitely
employed it; a Spenserian genius, nay, a
genius by natural endowment richer probably
than even Spenser; that light which
shines so unexpectedly and without fellow
in our century, an Elizabethan born too
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>late, the early lost and admirably gifted
Keats.</p>

<p class='c005'>I say then that there are really but three
metres,—the ten-syllable couplet, blank
verse, and a third metre which I will not
yet name, but which is neither the Spenserian
stanza nor any form of ballad-verse,—between
which, as vehicles for Homer’s
poetry, the translator has to make his
choice. Everyone will at once remember
a thousand passages in which both the ten-syllable
couplet and blank verse prove themselves
to have nobleness. Undoubtedly the
movement and manner of this,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Still raise for good the supplicating voice,</div>
      <div class='line'>But leave to Heaven the measure and the choice,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>are noble. Undoubtedly, the movement
and manner of this:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>High on a throne of royal state, which far</div>
      <div class='line'>Outshone the wealth of Ormus and of Ind,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>are noble also. But the first is in a rhymed
metre; and the unfitness of a rhymed metre
for rendering Homer I have already shown.
I will observe too, that the fine couplet
which I have quoted comes out of a satire,
a didactic poem; and that it is in didactic
poetry that the ten-syllable couplet has most
successfully essayed the grand style. In
narrative poetry this metre has succeeded
best when it essayed a sensibly lower style,
the style of Chaucer, for instance; whose
narrative manner, though a very good and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>sound manner, is certainly neither the grand
manner nor the manner of Homer.</p>

<p class='c005'>The rhymed ten-syllable couplet being
thus excluded, blank verse offers itself for
the translator’s use. The first kind of
blank verse which naturally occurs to us
is the blank verse of Milton, which has been
employed, with more or less modification,
by Mr Cary in translating Dante, by Cowper,
and by Mr Wright in translating Homer.
How noble this metre is in Milton’s hands,
how completely it shows itself capable of
the grand, nay, of the grandest, style, I
need not say. To this metre, as used in
the <i>Paradise Lost</i>, our country owes the
glory of having produced one of the only
two poetical works in the grand style which
are to be found in the modern languages;
the <i>Divine Comedy</i> of Dante is the other.
England and Italy here stand alone; Spain,
France, and Germany, have produced great
poets, but neither Calderon, nor Corneille,
nor Schiller, nor even Goethe, has produced
a body of poetry in the true grand style,
in the sense in which the style of the body
of Homer’s poetry, or Pindar’s, or Sophocles’s,
is grand. But Dante has, and so
has Milton; and in this respect Milton possesses
a distinction which even Shakspeare,
undoubtedly the supreme poetical power in
our literature, does not share with him.
Not a tragedy of Shakspeare but contains
passages in the worst of all styles, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>affected style; and the grand style, although
it may be harsh, or obscure, or
cumbrous, or over-laboured, is never affected.
In spite, therefore, of objections
which may justly be urged against the plan
and treatment of the <i>Paradise Lost</i>, in spite
of its possessing, certainly, a far less enthralling
force of interest to attract and to
carry forward the reader than the <i>Iliad</i> or
the <i>Divine Comedy</i>, it fully deserves, it can
never lose, its immense reputation; for, like
the <i>Iliad</i> and the <i>Divine Comedy</i>, nay, in
some respects to a higher degree than either
of them, it is in the grand style.</p>

<p class='c005'>But the grandeur of Milton is one thing,
and the grandeur of Homer is another.
Homer’s movement, I have said again and
again, is a flowing, a rapid movement;
Milton’s, on the other hand, is a laboured,
a self-retarding movement. In each case,
the movement, the metrical cast, corresponds
with the mode of evolution of the thought,
with the syntactical cast, and is indeed
determined by it. Milton charges himself
so full with thought, imagination, knowledge,
that his style will hardly contain
them. He is too full-stored to show us
in much detail one conception, one piece
of knowledge; he just shows it to us in a
pregnant allusive way, and then he presses
on to another; and all this fulness, this
pressure, this condensation, this self-constraint,
enters into his movement, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>makes it what it is,—noble, but difficult
and austere. Homer is quite different; he
says a thing, and says it to the end, and then
begins another, while Milton is trying to
press a thousand things into one. So that
whereas, in reading Milton, you never lose
the sense of laborious and condensed fulness,
in reading Homer you never lose the sense
of flowing and abounding ease. With
Milton line runs into line, and all is straitly
bound together: with Homer line runs off
from line, and all hurries away onward.
Homer begins, Μῆνιν ἄειδε, Θεά,—at the
second word announcing the proposed
action: Milton begins:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Of man’s first disobedience, and the fruit</div>
      <div class='line'>Of that forbidden tree, whose mortal taste</div>
      <div class='line'>Brought death into the world, and all our woe,</div>
      <div class='line'>With loss of Eden, till one greater Man</div>
      <div class='line'>Restore us, and regain the blissful seat,</div>
      <div class='line'>Sing, heavenly muse.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>So chary of a sentence is he, so resolute
not to let it escape him till he has crowded
into it all he can, that it is not till the
thirty-ninth word in the sentence that he
will give us the key to it, the word of action,
the verb. Milton says:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>O for that warning voice, which he, who saw</div>
      <div class='line'>The Apocalypse, heard cry in heaven aloud.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>He is not satisfied, unless he can tell us,
all in one sentence, and without permitting
himself to actually mention the name, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>the man who had the warning voice was
the same man who saw the Apocalypse.
Homer would have said, ‘O for that warning
voice, which <i>John</i> heard’—and if it had
suited him to say that John also saw the
Apocalypse, he would have given us that
in another sentence. The effect of this
allusive and compressed manner of Milton
is, I need not say, often very powerful;
and it is an effect which other great poets
have often sought to obtain much in the
same way: Dante is full of it, Horace is
full of it; but wherever it exists, it is always
an un-Homeric effect. ‘The losses of the
heavens’, says Horace, ‘fresh moons
speedily repair; we, when we have gone
down where the pious Æneas, where the
rich Tullus and Ancus are,—<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>pulvis et umbra
sumus</i></span><a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c009'><sup>[26]</sup></a>’. He never actually says <i>where</i>
we go to; he only indicates it by saying
that it is that place where Æneas, Tullus,
and Ancus are. But Homer, when he has
to speak of going down to the grave, says,
definitely, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><em class='gesperrt'>ἐς Ἐλύσιοv πεδιον</em>—ἀθάνατοι
πέμψουσιν</span><a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c009'><sup>[27]</sup></a>,—‘The immortals shall send
thee <i>to the Elysian plain</i>’; and it is not
till after he has definitely said this, that
he adds, that it is there that the abode
of departed worthies is placed: <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὅθι ξανθὸς
Ῥαδάμανθυς</span>—‘Where the yellow-haired
Rhadamanthus is’. Again; Horace,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>having to say that punishment sooner or
later overtakes crime, says it thus:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Raro antecedentem scelestum</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Deseruit pede Pœna claudo</span><a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c009'><sup>[28]</sup></a>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The thought itself of these lines is familiar
enough to Homer and Hesiod; but neither
Homer nor Hesiod, in expressing it, could
possibly have so complicated its expression
as Horace complicates it, and purposely
complicates it, by his use of the word
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>deseruit</i></span>. I say that this complicated evolution
of the thought necessarily complicates
the movement and rhythm of a poet; and
that the Miltonic blank verse, of course the
first model of blank verse which suggests
itself to an English translator of Homer,
bears the strongest marks of such complication,
and is therefore entirely unfit to
render Homer.</p>

<p class='c005'>If blank verse is used in translating
Homer, it must be a blank verse of which
English poetry, naturally swayed much by
Milton’s treatment of this metre, offers at
present hardly any examples. It must not
be Cowper’s blank verse, who has studied
Milton’s pregnant manner with such effect,
that, having to say of Mr Throckmorton
that he spares his avenue, although it is
the fashion with other people to cut down
theirs, he says that Benevolus ‘reprieves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>the obsolete prolixity of shade’. It must
not be Mr Tennyson’s blank verse.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>For all experience is an arch, wherethrough</div>
      <div class='line'>Gleams that untravelled world, whose distance fades</div>
      <div class='line'>For ever and for ever, as we gaze.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>It is no blame to the thought of those lines,
which belongs to another order of ideas than
Homer’s, but it is true, that Homer would
certainly have said of them, ‘It is to consider
too curiously to consider so’. It is
no blame to their rhythm, which belongs to
another order of movement than Homer’s,
but it is true that these three lines by themselves
take up nearly as much time as a
whole book of the <i>Iliad</i>. No; the blank
verse used in rendering Homer must be a
blank verse of which perhaps the best specimens
are to be found in some of the most
rapid passages of Shakspeare’s plays,—a
blank verse which does not dovetail its lines
into one another, and which habitually ends
its lines with monosyllables. Such a blank
verse might no doubt be very rapid in its
movement, and might perfectly adapt itself
to a thought plainly and directly evolved;
and it would be interesting to see it well
applied to Homer. But the translator who
determines to use it, must not conceal from
himself that in order to pour Homer into
the mould of this metre, he will have entirely
to break him up and melt him down,
with the hope of then successfully composing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>him afresh; and this is a process
which is full of risks. It may, no doubt,
be the real Homer that issues new from it;
it is not certain beforehand that it cannot
be the real Homer, as it is certain that
from the mould of Pope’s couplet or Cowper’s
Miltonic verse it cannot be the real
Homer that will issue; still, the chances of
disappointment are great. The result of
such an attempt to renovate the old poet
may be an Æson; but it may also, and
more probably will be a Pelias.</p>

<p class='c005'>When I say this, I point to the metre
which seems to me to give the translator
the best chance of preserving the general
effect of Homer,—that third metre which
I have not yet expressly named, the hexameter.
I know all that is said against
the use of hexameters in English poetry;
but it comes only to this, that, among
us, they have not yet been used on any
considerable scale with success. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Solvitur
ambulando</i></span>: this is an objection which can
best be met by <i>producing</i> good English hexameters.
And there is no reason in the
nature of the English language why it
should not adapt itself to hexameters as
well as the German language does; nay,
the English language, from its greater
rapidity, is in itself better suited than
the German for them. The hexameter,
whether alone or with the pentameter,
possesses a movement, an expression, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>no metre hitherto in common use amongst
us possesses, and which I am convinced
English poetry, as our mental wants multiply,
will not always be content to forgo.
Applied to Homer, this metre affords to
the translator the immense support of
keeping him more nearly than any other
metre to Homer’s movement; and, since
a poet’s movement makes so large a part
of his general effect, and to reproduce this
general effect is at once the translator’s
indispensable business and so difficult for
him, it is a great thing to have this part
of your model’s general effect already
given you in your metre, instead of
having to get it entirely for yourself.</p>

<p class='c005'>These are general considerations; but
there are also one or two particular considerations
which confirm me in the opinion
that for translating Homer into English
verse the hexameter should be used. The
most successful attempt hitherto made at
rendering Homer into English, the attempt
in which Homer’s general effect has been
best retained, is an attempt made in the
hexameter measure. It is a version of the
famous lines in the third book of the <i>Iliad</i>,
which end with that mention of Castor and
Pollux from which Mr Ruskin extracts the
sentimental consolation already noticed by
me. The author is the accomplished Provost
of Eton, Dr Hawtrey; and this performance
of his must be my excuse for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>having taken the liberty to single him out
for mention, as one of the natural judges of
a translation of Homer, along with Professor
Thompson and Professor Jowett,
whose connection with Greek literature is
official. The passage is short<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c009'><sup>[29]</sup></a>; and Dr
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>Hawtrey’s version of it is suffused with a
pensive grace which is, perhaps, rather more
Virgilian than Homeric; still it is the one
version of any part of the <i>Iliad</i> which in
some degree reproduces for me the original
effect of Homer: it is the best, and it is in
hexameters.</p>

<p class='c005'>This is one of the particular considerations
that incline me to prefer the hexameter,
for translating Homer, to our established
metres. There is another. Most of you,
probably, have some knowledge of a poem
by Mr Clough, <i>The Bothie of Toper-na-fuosich</i>,
a long-vacation pastoral, in hexameters.
The general merits of that poem
I am not going to discuss: it is a serio-comic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>poem, and, therefore, of essentially
different nature from the <i>Iliad</i>. Still in
two things it is, more than any other English
poem which I can call to mind, like the
<i>Iliad</i>: in the rapidity of its movement,
and the plainness and directness of its style.
The thought of this poem is often curious
and subtle, and that is not Homeric; the
diction is often grotesque, and that is not
Homeric. Still by its rapidity of movement,
and plain and direct manner of presenting
the thought however curious in
itself, this poem, which, being as I say a
serio-comic poem, has a right to be grotesque,
is grotesque <i>truly</i>, not, like Mr Newman’s
version of the <i>Iliad</i>, <i>falsely</i>. Mr Clough’s
odd epithets, ‘The grave man nicknamed
Adam’, ‘The hairy Aldrich’, and so on,
grow vitally and appear naturally in their
place; while Mr Newman’s ‘dapper-greaved
Achaians’, and ‘motley-helmed Hector’,
have all the air of being mechanically elaborated
and artificially stuck in. Mr Clough’s
hexameters are excessively, needlessly
rough; still owing to the native rapidity
of this measure, and to the directness of
style which so well allies itself with it, his
composition produces a sense in the reader
which Homer’s composition also produces,
and which Homer’s translator ought to <i>re</i>-produce,—the
sense of having, within short
limits of time, a large portion of human life
presented to him, instead of a small portion.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>Mr Clough’s hexameters are, as I have
just said, too rough and irregular; and indeed
a good model, on any considerable
scale, of this metre, the English translator
will nowhere find. He must not follow the
model offered by Mr Longfellow in his
pleasing and popular poem of <i>Evangeline</i>;
for the merit of the manner and movement
of <i>Evangeline</i>, when they are at their best,
is to be tenderly elegant; and their fault,
when they are at their worst, is to be
lumbering; but Homer’s defect is not
lumberingness, neither is tender elegance
his excellence. The lumbering effect of
most English hexameters is caused by their
being much too dactylic<a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c009'><sup>[30]</sup></a>; the translator
must learn to use spondees freely. Mr
Clough has done this, but he has not sufficiently
observed another rule which the translator
cannot follow too strictly; and that
is, to have no lines which will not, as it is
familiarly said, <i>read themselves</i>. This is of
the last importance for rhythms with which
the ear of the English public is not
thoroughly acquainted. Lord Redesdale,
in two papers on the subject of Greek and
Roman metres, has some good remarks on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>the outrageous disregard of quantity in
which English verse, trusting to its force
of accent, is apt to indulge itself. The
predominance of accent in our language is
so great, that it would be pedantic not to
avail oneself of it; and Lord Redesdale
suggests rules which might easily be pushed
too far. Still, it is undeniable that in
English hexameters we generally force the
quantity far too much; we rely on justification
by accent with a security which is
excessive. But not only do we abuse accent
by shortening long syllables and lengthening
short ones; we perpetually commit a far
worse fault, by requiring the removal of
the accent from its natural place to an unnatural
one, in order to make our line scan.
This is a fault, even when our metre is one
which every English reader knows, and
when we can see what we want and can
correct the rhythm according to our wish;
although it is a fault which a great master
may sometimes commit knowingly to produce
a desired effect, as Milton changes the
natural accent on the word <i>Tiresias</i> in the
line:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>And Tíresias and Phineus, prophets old;</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>and then it ceases to be a fault, and becomes
a beauty. But it is a real fault, when
Chapman has:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>By him the golden-throned Queen slept, the Queen of Deities;</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>for in this line, to make it scan, you have
to take away the accent from the word
<i>Queen</i>, on which it naturally falls, and to
place it on <i>throned</i>, which would naturally
be unaccented; and yet, after all, you get
no peculiar effect or beauty of cadence to
reward you. It is a real fault, when Mr
Newman has:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Infatuate! O that thou wert lord to some other army—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>for here again the reader is required, not
for any special advantage to himself, but
simply to save Mr Newman trouble, to place
the accent on the insignificant word <i>wert</i>,
where it has no business whatever. But
it is still a greater fault, when Spenser has
(to take a striking instance):</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Wot ye why his mother with a veil hath covered his face?</div>

<p class='c008'>for a hexameter; because here not only is
the reader causelessly required to make
havoc with the natural accentuation of the
line in order to get it to run as a hexameter;
but also he, in nine cases out of ten, will be
utterly at a loss how to perform the process
required, and the line will remain a mere
monster for him. I repeat, it is advisable
to construct <i>all</i> verses so that by reading
them naturally—that is, according to the
sense and legitimate accent,—the reader gets
the right rhythm; but, for English hexameters,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>that they be so constructed is indispensable.</p>

<p class='c005'>If the hexameter best helps the translator
to the Homeric rapidity, what style may
best help him to the Homeric plainness
and directness? It is the merit of a metre
appropriate to your subject, that it in
some degree suggests and carries with itself
a style appropriate to the subject; the
elaborate and self-retarding style, which
comes so naturally when your metre is the
Miltonic blank verse, does not come naturally
with the hexameter; is, indeed, alien to it.
On the other hand, the hexameter has a
natural dignity which repels both the jaunty
style and the jog-trot style, to both of which
the ballad-measure so easily lends itself.
These are great advantages; and, perhaps,
it is nearly enough to say to the translator
who uses the hexameter that he cannot too
religiously follow, in style, the inspiration
of his metre. He will find that a loose
and idiomatic grammar—a grammar which
follows the essential rather than the
formal logic of the thought—allies itself excellently
with the hexameter; and that,
while this sort of grammar ensures plainness
and naturalness, it by no means comes
short in nobleness. It is difficult to pronounce,
certainly, what is idiomatic in the
ancient literature of a language which,
though still spoken, has long since entirely
adopted, as modern Greek has adopted,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>modern idioms. Still one may, I think,
clearly perceive that Homer’s grammatical
style is idiomatic,—that it may even be
called, not improperly, a loose grammatical
style<a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c009'><sup>[31]</sup></a>. Examples, however, of what I
mean by a loose grammatical style, will be
of more use to the translator if taken from
English poetry than if taken from Homer.
I call it, then, a loose and idiomatic grammar
which Shakspeare uses in the last line of
the following three:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in14'>He’s here in double trust:</div>
      <div class='line'>First, as I am his kinsman and his subject,</div>
      <div class='line'><i>Strong both against the deed</i>;</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>or in this:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Wit, <i>whither wilt</i>?</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>What Shakspeare means is perfectly clear,
clearer, probably, than if he had said it in
a more formal and regular manner; but
his grammar is loose and idiomatic, because
he leaves out the subject of the verb ‘wilt’
in the second passage quoted, and because,
in the first, a prodigious addition to the
sentence has to be, as we used to say in
our old Latin grammar days, <i>understood</i>,
before the word ‘both’ can be properly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>parsed. So, again, Chapman’s grammar is
loose and idiomatic where he says,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Even share hath he that keeps his tent, and <i>he to field</i> doth go,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>because he leaves out, in the second clause,
the relative which in formal writing would
be required. But Chapman here does not
lose dignity by this idiomatic way of expressing
himself, any more than Shakspeare
loses it by neglecting to confer on ‘both’
the blessings of a regular government:
neither loses dignity, but each gives that
impression of a plain, direct, and natural
mode of speaking, which Homer, too, gives,
and which it is so important, as I say, that
Homer’s translator should succeed in giving.
Cowper calls blank verse ‘a style further
removed than rhyme from the vernacular
idiom, both in the language itself and in
the arrangement of it’; and just in proportion
as blank verse is removed from the
vernacular idiom, from that idiomatic style
which is of all styles the plainest and most
natural, blank verse is unsuited to render
Homer.</p>

<p class='c005'>Shakspeare is not only idiomatic in his
grammar or style, he is also idiomatic in
his words or diction; and here too, his
example is valuable for the translator of
Homer. The translator must not, indeed,
allow himself all the liberty that Shakspeare
allows himself; for Shakspeare sometimes
uses expressions which pass perfectly well
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>as he uses them, because Shakspeare thinks
so fast and so powerfully, that in reading
him we are borne over single words as by a
mighty current; but, if our mind were less
excited,—and who may rely on exciting our
mind like Shakspeare?—they would check
us. ‘To grunt and sweat under a weary
load’;—that does perfectly well where it
comes in Shakspeare; but if the translator
of Homer, who will hardly have wound our
minds up to the pitch at which these words
of Hamlet find them, were to employ, when
he has to speak of one of Homer’s heroes
under the load of calamity, this figure of
‘grunting’ and ‘sweating’ we should say,
<i>He Newmanises</i>, and his diction would offend
us. For he is to be noble; and no plea of
wishing to be plain and natural can get him
excused from being this: only, as he is to
be also, like Homer, perfectly simple and
free from artificiality, and as the use of
idiomatic expressions undoubtedly gives this
effect<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c009'><sup>[32]</sup></a>, he should be as idiomatic as he can
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>be without ceasing to be noble. Therefore
the idiomatic language of Shakspeare—such
language as, ‘prate of his <i>whereabout</i>’;
‘<i>jump</i> the life to come’; ‘the damnation of
his <i>taking-off</i>’; ‘his <i>quietus make</i> with a
bare <i>bodkin</i>’—should be carefully observed
by the translator of Homer, although in
every case he will have to decide for himself
whether the use, by him, of Shakspeare’s
liberty, will or will not clash with his indispensable
duty of nobleness. He will find
one English book and one only, where, as
in the <i>Iliad</i> itself, perfect plainness of speech
is allied with perfect nobleness; and that
book is the Bible. No one could see this
more clearly than Pope saw it: ‘This pure
and noble simplicity’, he says, ‘is nowhere
in such perfection as in the Scripture and
Homer’: yet even with Pope a woman is
a ‘fair’, a father is a ‘sire’ and an old
man a ‘reverend sage’, and so on through
all the phrases of that pseudo-Augustan,
and most unbiblical, vocabulary. The
Bible, however, is undoubtedly the grand
mine of diction for the translator of Homer;
and, if he knows how to discriminate truly
between what will suit him and what will
not, the Bible may afford him also invaluable
lessons of style.</p>

<p class='c005'>I said that Homer, besides being plain
in style and diction, was plain in the quality
of his thought. It is possible that a thought
may be expressed with idiomatic plainness,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>and yet not be in itself a plain thought.
For example, in Mr Clough’s poem, already
mentioned, the style and diction is almost
always idiomatic and plain, but the thought
itself is often of a quality which is not plain;
it is <i>curious</i>. But the grand instance of
the union of idiomatic expression with curious
or difficult thought is in Shakspeare’s
poetry. Such, indeed, is the force and
power of Shakspeare’s idiomatic expression,
that it gives an effect of clearness and vividness
even to a thought which is imperfect
and incoherent; for instance, when Hamlet
says,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>To take arms against a sea of troubles,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>the figure there is undoubtedly most faulty,
it by no means runs on four legs; but the
thing is said so freely and idiomatically,
that it passes. This, however, is not a
point to which I now want to call your
attention; I want you to remark, in Shakspeare
and others, only that which we may
directly apply to Homer. I say, then, that
in Shakspeare the thought is often, while
most idiomatically uttered, nay, while good
and sound in itself, yet of a quality which
is curious and difficult; and that this quality
of thought is something entirely un-Homeric.
For example, when Lady Macbeth says:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in4'>Memory, the warder of the brain,</div>
      <div class='line'>Shall be a fume, and the receipt of reason</div>
      <div class='line'>A limbeck only,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>this figure is a perfectly sound and correct
figure, no doubt; Mr Knight even calls it
a ‘happy’ figure; but it is a <i>difficult</i> figure:
Homer would not have used it. Again,
when Lady Macbeth says,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>When you durst do it, then you were a man;</div>
      <div class='line'>And, to be more than what you were, you would</div>
      <div class='line'>Be so much more the man,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>the thought in the two last of these lines is,
when you seize it, a perfectly clear thought,
and a fine thought; but it is a <i>curious</i>
thought: Homer would not have used it.
These are favourable instances of the union
of plain style and words with a thought not
plain in quality; but take stronger instances
of this union,—let the thought be not only
not plain in quality, but highly fanciful:
and you have the Elizabethan conceits;
you have, in spite of idiomatic style and
idiomatic diction, everything which is most
un-Homeric; you have such atrocities as
this of Chapman:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in6'>Fate shall fail to vent her gall</div>
      <div class='line'>Till mine vent thousands.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>I say, the poets of a nation which has produced
such conceit as that, must purify
themselves seven times in the fire before
they can hope to render Homer. They must
expel their nature with a fork, and keep
crying to one another night and day:
‘Homer not only moves rapidly, not only
speaks idiomatically; he is, also, <i>free from
fancifulness</i>’.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>So essentially characteristic of Homer is
his plainness and naturalness of thought,
that to the preservation of this in his own
version the translator must without scruple
sacrifice, where it is necessary, verbal fidelity
to his original, rather than run any risk of
producing, by literalness, an odd and unnatural
effect. The double epithets so constantly
occurring in Homer must be dealt
with according to this rule; these epithets
come quite naturally in Homer’s poetry;
in English poetry they, in nine cases out of
ten, come, when literally rendered, quite
unnaturally. I will not now discuss why
this is so, I assume it as an indisputable
fact that it is so; that Homer’s <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μερόπων
ἀνθρώπων</span> comes to the reader as something
perfectly natural, while Mr Newman’s
‘voice-dividing mortals’ comes to him as
something perfectly unnatural. Well then,
as it is Homer’s general effect which we are
to reproduce, it is to be false to Homer to
be so verbally faithful to him as that we
lose this effect: and by the English translator
Homer’s double epithets must be, in
many places, renounced altogether; in all
places where they are rendered, rendered by
equivalents which come naturally. Instead
of rendering <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θέτι τανύπεπλε</span> by Mr Newman’s
‘Thetis trailing-robed’, which brings to
one’s mind long petticoats sweeping a dirty
pavement, the translator must render the
Greek by English words which come as naturally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>to us as Milton’s words when he says,
‘Let gorgeous Tragedy With sceptred pall
come sweeping by’. Instead of rendering
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μώνυχας ἵππους</span> by Chapman’s ‘one-hoofed
steeds’, or Mr Newman’s ‘single-hoofed
horses’, he must speak of horses in a way
which surprises us as little as Shakspeare
surprises when he says, ‘Gallop apace, you
fiery-footed steeds’. Instead of rendering
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μελιηδέα θυμόν</span> by ‘life as honey pleasant’,
he must characterise life with the simple
pathos of Gray’s ‘warm precincts of the
cheerful day’. Instead of converting <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ποῖόν
σε ἔπoς φύγεν ἔρκος ὀδόντων;</span> into the portentous
remonstrance, ‘Betwixt the outwork
of thy teeth what word hath split’?
he must remonstrate in English as straightforward
as this of St Peter, ‘Be it far from
thee, Lord: this shall not be unto thee’;
or as this of the disciples, ‘What is this that
he saith, a little while? we cannot tell what
he saith’. Homer’s Greek, in each of the
places quoted, reads as naturally as any of
those English passages: the expression no
more calls away the attention from the
sense in the Greek than in the English.
But when, in order to render literally in
English one of Homer’s double epithets, a
strange unfamiliar adjective is invented,—such
as ‘voice-dividing’ for <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μέρψς</span>,—an
improper share of the reader’s attention is
necessarily diverted to this ancillary word,
to this word which Homer never intended
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>should receive so much notice; and a total
effect quite different from Homer’s is thus
produced. Therefore Mr Newman, though
he does not purposely import, like Chapman,
conceits of his own into the <i>Iliad</i>, does
actually import them; for the result of his
singular diction is to raise ideas, and odd
ideas, not raised by the corresponding diction
in Homer; and Chapman himself does no
more. Cowper says: ‘I have cautiously
avoided all terms of new invention, with an
abundance of which persons of more ingenuity
than judgment have not enriched
our language but encumbered it’; and
this criticism so exactly hits the diction of
Mr Newman that one is irresistibly led to
imagine his present appearance in the flesh
to be at least his second.</p>

<p class='c005'>A translator cannot well have a Homeric
rapidity, style, diction, and quality of
thought, without at the same time having
what is the result of these in Homer,—nobleness.
Therefore I do not attempt to
lay down any rules for obtaining this effect
of nobleness,—the effect, too, of all others
the most impalpable, the most irreducible
to rule, and which most depends on the individual
personality of the artist. So I proceed
at once to give you, in conclusion, one
or two passages in which I have tried to
follow those principles of Homeric translation
which I have laid down. I give them,
it must be remembered, not as specimens of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>perfect translation, but as specimens of an
attempt to translate Homer on certain principles;
specimens which may very aptly
illustrate those principles by falling short
as well as by succeeding.</p>

<p class='c005'>I take first a passage of which I have
already spoken, the comparison of the Trojan
fires to the stars. The first part of that
passage is, I have said, of splendid beauty;
and to begin with a lame version of that
would be the height of imprudence in me.
It is the last and more level part with which
I shall concern myself. I have already
quoted Cowper’s version of this part in
order to show you how unlike his stiff and
Miltonic manner of telling a plain story is
to Homer’s easy and rapid manner:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>So numerous seemed those fires the bank between</div>
      <div class='line'>Of Xanthus, blazing, and the fleet of Greece,</div>
      <div class='line'>In prospect all of Troy—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>I need not continue to the end. I have also
quoted Pope’s version of it, to show you how
unlike his ornate and artificial manner is to
Homer’s plain and natural manner:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>So many flames before proud Ilion blaze,</div>
      <div class='line'>And brighten glimmering Xanthus with their rays;</div>
      <div class='line'>The long reflections of the distant fires</div>
      <div class='line'>Gleam on the walls, and tremble on the spires,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>and much more of the same kind. I want
to show you that it is possible, in a plain
passage of this sort, to keep Homer’s simplicity
without being heavy and dull; and
to keep his dignity without bringing in pomp
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>and ornament. ‘As numerous as are the
stars on a clear night’, says Homer,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>So shone forth, in front of Troy, by the bed of Xanthus,</div>
      <div class='line'>Between that and the ships, the Trojans’ numerous fires.</div>
      <div class='line'>In the plain there were kindled a thousand fires: by each one</div>
      <div class='line'>There sat fifty men, in the ruddy light of the fire:</div>
      <div class='line'>By their chariots stood the steeds, and champed the white barley</div>
      <div class='line'>While their masters sat by the fire, and waited for Morning.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Here, in order to keep Homer’s effect of
perfect plainness and directness, I repeat
the word ‘fires’ as he repeats πυρά without
scruple; although in a more elaborate and
literary style of poetry this recurrence of
the same word would be a fault to be
avoided. I omit the epithet of Morning,
and whereas Homer says that the steeds
‘waited for Morning’, I prefer to attribute
this expectation of Morning to the master
and not to the horse. Very likely in this
particular, as in any other single particular,
I may be wrong: what I wish you to remark
is my endeavour after absolute plainness
of speech, my care to avoid anything which
may the least check or surprise the reader,
whom Homer does not check or surprise.
Homer’s lively personal familiarity with
war, and with the war-horse as his master’s
companion, is such that, as it seems to me,
his attributing to the one the other’s feelings
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>comes to us quite naturally; but, from a
poet without this familiarity, the attribution
strikes as a little unnatural; and therefore,
as everything the least unnatural is un-Homeric,
I avoid it.</p>

<p class='c005'>Again, in the address of Zeus to the horses
of Achilles, Cowper has:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Jove saw their grief with pity, and his brows</div>
      <div class='line'>Shaking, within himself thus, pensive, said.</div>
      <div class='line in6'>‘Ah hapless pair! wherefore by gift divine</div>
      <div class='line'>Were ye to Peleus given, a mortal king,</div>
      <div class='line'>Yourselves immortal and from age exempt?’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>There is no want of dignity here, as in the
versions of Chapman and Mr Newman,
which I have already quoted: but the whole
effect is much too slow. Take Pope:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Nor Jove disdained to cast a pitying look</div>
      <div class='line'>While thus relenting to the steeds he spoke.</div>
      <div class='line in6'>‘Unhappy coursers of immortal strain!</div>
      <div class='line'>Exempt from age and deathless now in vain;</div>
      <div class='line'>Did we your race on mortal man bestow</div>
      <div class='line'>Only, alas! to share in mortal woe?’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Here there is no want either of dignity or
rapidity, but all is too artificial. ‘Nor Jove
disdained’, for instance, is a very artificial
and literary way of rendering Homer’s
words and so is, ‘coursers of immortal
strain’.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Μυρομένω δ’ ἄρα τώ γε ἰδὼν, ἐλέησε Κρονίων.</span></div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>And with pity the son of Saturn saw them bewailing,</div>
      <div class='line'>And he shook his head, and thus addressed his own bosom.</div>
      <div class='line in6'><span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>‘Ah, unhappy pair, to Peleus why did we give you,</div>
      <div class='line'>To a mortal? but ye are without old age and immortal.</div>
      <div class='line'>Was it that ye, with man, might have your thousands of sorrows?</div>
      <div class='line'>For than man, indeed, there breathes no wretcheder creature,</div>
      <div class='line'>Of all living things, that on earth are breathing and moving’.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Here I will observe that the use of ‘own’,
in the second line for the last syllable of a
dactyl, and the use of ‘To a’, in the fourth,
for a complete spondee, though they do
not, I think, actually spoil the run of the
hexameter, are yet undoubtedly instances
of that over-reliance on accent, and too free
disregard of quantity, which Lord Redesdale
visits with just reprehension<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c009'><sup>[33]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>I now take two longer passages in order
to try my method more fully; but I still
keep to passages which have already come
under our notice. I quoted Chapman’s
version of some passages in the speech of
Hector at his parting with Andromache.
One astounding conceit will probably still
be in your remembrance,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>When sacred Troy shall <i>shed her tow’rs for tears of overthrow</i>,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>as a translation of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὅτ’ ἄν ποτ’ ὀλώλῃ Ἴλιος ἰρή</span>.
I will quote a few lines which will give you,
also, the key-note to the Anglo-Augustan
manner of rendering this passage and to the
Miltonic manner of rendering it. What Mr
Newman’s manner of rendering it would be,
you can by this time sufficiently imagine for
yourselves. Mr Wright,—to quote for once
from his meritorious version instead of
Cowper’s, whose strong and weak points
are those of Mr Wright also,—Mr Wright
begins his version of this passage thus:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>All these thy anxious cares are also mine,</div>
      <div class='line'>Partner beloved; but how could I endure</div>
      <div class='line'>The scorn of Trojans and their long-robed wives,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>Should they behold their Hector shrink from war,</div>
      <div class='line'>And act the coward’s part! Nor doth my soul</div>
      <div class='line'>Prompt the base thought.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Ex pede Herculem</i></span>: you see just what the
manner is. Mr Sotheby, on the other hand
(to take a disciple of Pope instead of Pope
himself), begins thus:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘What moves thee, moves my mind,’ brave Hector said,</div>

<p class='c008'>that is what Homer has, that is his style
and movement, if one could but catch it.
Andromache, as you know, has been entreating
Hector to defend Troy from within
the walls, instead of exposing his life, and,
with his own life, the safety of all those
dearest to him, by fighting in the open
plain. Hector replies:</p>

      <div class='line'>Always, and always fighting among the first of the Trojans,</div>
      <div class='line'>Busy for Priam’s fame and my own, in spite of the future.</div>
      <div class='line'>For that day will come, my soul is assured of its coming,</div>

      <div class='line'>Troy, and warlike Priam too, and the people of Priam.</div>
      <div class='line'>And yet not that grief, which then will be, of the Trojans,</div>
      <div class='line'>Moves me so much—not Hecuba’s grief, nor Priam my father’s,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor my brethren’s, many and brave, who then will be lying</div>
      <div class='line'>In the bloody dust, beneath the feet of their foemen—</div>
      <div class='line'>As thy grief, when, in tears, some brazen-coated Achaian</div>
      <div class='line'>Shall transport thee away, and the day of thy freedom be ended.</div>
      <div class='line'>Then, perhaps, thou shalt work at the loom of another, in Argos,</div>

      <div class='line'><i>Of the horsemen of Troy, in the day they fought for their city</i>.</div>
      <div class='line'>So some man will say; and then thy grief will redouble</div>
      <div class='line'>At thy want of a man like me, to save thee from bondage.</div>
      <div class='line'>But let me be dead, and the earth be mounded above me,</div>

</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>The main question, whether or no this
version reproduces for him the movement
and general effect of Homer better than
other versions<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c009'><sup>[34]</sup></a> of the same passage, I leave
for the judgment of the scholar. But the
particular points, in which the operation
of my own rules is manifested, are as follows.
In the second line I leave out the epithet of
the Trojan women <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἑλκεσιπέπλους</span>, altogether.
In the sixth line I put in five words ‘in
spite of the future’, which are in the original
by implication only, and are not there
actually expressed. This I do, because
Homer, as I have before said, is so remote
from one who reads him in English, that
the English translator must be even plainer,
if possible, and more unambiguous than
Homer himself; the connection of meaning
must be even more distinctly marked in
the translation than in the original. For
in the Greek language itself there is something
which brings one nearer to Homer,
which gives one a clue to his thought, which
makes a hint enough; but in the English
language this sense of nearness, this clue,
is gone; hints are insufficient, everything
must be stated with full distinctness. In
the ninth line Homer’s epithet for Priam is
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐυμμελίω</span>,—‘armed with good ashen spear’,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>say the dictionaries; ‘ashen-speared’,
translates Mr Newman, following his own
rule to ‘retain every peculiarity of his
original’,—I say, on the other hand, that
ἐυμμελίω has not the effect of a ‘peculiarity’
in the original, while ‘ashen-speared’ has
the effect of a ‘peculiarity’ in English; and
‘warlike’ is as marking an equivalent as I
dare give for <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐυμμελίω</span>, for fear of disturbing
the balance of expression in Homer’s sentence.
In the fourteenth line, again, I translate
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χαλκοχιτώνων</span> by ‘brazen-coated’. Mr
Newman, meaning to be perfectly literal,
translates it by ‘brazen-cloaked’, an expression
which comes to the reader oddly
and unnaturally, while Homer’s word comes
to him quite naturally; but I venture to
go as near to a literal rendering as ‘brazen-coated’,
because a ‘coat of brass’ is familiar
to us all from the Bible, and familiar, too,
as distinctly specified in connection with
the wearer. Finally, let me further illustrate
from the twentieth line the value which
I attach, in a question of diction, to the
authority of the Bible. The word ‘pre-eminent’
occurs in that line; I was a little
in doubt whether that was not too bookish
an expression to be used in rendering Homer,
as I can imagine Mr Newman to have been
a little in doubt whether his ‘responsively
accosted’ for <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀμειβόμενος προσέφη</span>, was not
too bookish an expression. Let us both, I
say, consult our Bibles: Mr Newman will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>nowhere find it in his Bible that David, for
instance, ‘<i>responsively accosted</i> Goliath’;
but I do find in mine that ‘the right hand
of the Lord hath the <i>pre-eminence</i>’; and
forthwith I use ‘pre-eminent’, without
scruple. My Bibliolatry is perhaps excessive;
and no doubt a true poetic feeling
is the Homeric translator’s best guide in
the use of words; but where this feeling
does not exist, or is at fault, I think he
cannot do better than take for a mechanical
guide Cruden’s <i>Concordance</i>. To be sure,
here as elsewhere, the consulter must know
how to consult,—must know how very slight
a variation of word or circumstance makes
the difference between an authority in his
favour, and an authority which gives him
no countenance at all; for instance, the
‘Great simpleton!’ (for <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μέγα νήπιος</span>) of Mr
Newman, and the ‘Thou fool!’ of the
Bible, are something alike; but ‘Thou
fool!’ is very grand, and ‘Great simpleton!’
is an atrocity. So, too, Chapman’s
‘Poor wretched beasts’ is pitched many
degrees too low; but Shakspeare’s ‘Poor
venomous fool, Be angry and despatch!’
is in the grand style.</p>

<p class='c005'>One more piece of translation and I have
done. I will take the passage in which
both Chapman and Mr Newman have already
so much excited our astonishment,
the passage at the end of the nineteenth
book of the <i>Iliad</i>, the dialogue between
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>Achilles and his horse Xanthus, after the
death of Patroclus. Achilles begins:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Xanthus and Balius both, ye far-famed seed of Podarga!</div>
      <div class='line'>See that ye bring your master home to the host of the Argives</div>
      <div class='line'>In some other sort than your last, when the battle is ended;</div>
      <div class='line'>And not leave him behind, a corpse on the plain, like Patroclus’.</div>
      <div class='line in6'>Then, from beneath the yoke, the fleet horse Xanthus addressed him:</div>
      <div class='line'>Sudden he bowed his head, and all his mane, as he bowed it,</div>
      <div class='line'>Streamed to the ground by the yoke, escaping from under the collar;</div>
      <div class='line'>And he was given a voice by the white-armed Goddess Hera.</div>
      <div class='line in6'>‘Truly, yet this time will we save thee, mighty Achilles!</div>
      <div class='line'>But thy day of death is at hand; nor shall <i>we</i> be the reason—</div>
      <div class='line'>No, but the will of heaven, and Fate’s invincible power.</div>
      <div class='line'>For by no slow pace or want of swiftness of ours</div>
      <div class='line'>Did the Trojans obtain to strip the arms from Patroclus;</div>
      <div class='line'>But that prince among Gods, the son of the lovely-haired Leto,</div>
      <div class='line'>Slew him fighting in front of the fray, and glorified Hector.</div>
      <div class='line'>But, for us, we vie in speed with the breath of the West-Wind,</div>
      <div class='line'>Which, men say, is the fleetest of winds; ’tis thou who art fated</div>
      <div class='line'>To lie low in death, by the hand of a God and a Mortal’.</div>
      <div class='line in6'>Thus far he; and here his voice was stopped by the Furies.</div>
      <div class='line'>Then, with a troubled heart, the swift Achilles addressed him:</div>
      <div class='line in6'><span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>‘Why dost thou prophesy so my death to me, Xanthus? It needs not.</div>
      <div class='line'>I of myself know well, that here I am destined to perish,</div>
      <div class='line'>Far from my father and mother dear: for all that I will not</div>
      <div class='line'>Stay this hand from fight, till the Trojans are utterly routed</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in6'>So he spake, and drove with a cry his steeds into battle.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Here the only particular remark which
I will make is, that in the fourth and eighth
line the grammar is what I call a loose and
idiomatic grammar. In writing a regular
and literary style, one would in the fourth
line have to repeat before ‘leave’ the words
‘that ye’ from the second line, and to insert
the word ‘do’; and in the eighth line
one would not use such an expression as
‘he was given a voice’. But I will make
one general remark on the character of my
own translations, as I have made so many
on that of the translations of others. It is,
that over the graver passages there is shed
an air somewhat too strenuous and severe,
by comparison with that lovely ease and
sweetness which Homer, for all his noble
and masculine way of thinking, never loses.</p>

<p class='c005'>Here I stop. I have said so much, because
I think that the task of translating
Homer into English verse both will be reattempted,
and may be reattempted successfully.
There are great works composed
of parts so disparate that one translator is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>not likely to have the requisite gifts for
poetically rendering all of them. Such are
the works of Shakspeare, and Goethe’s
<i>Faust</i>; and these it is best to attempt to
render in prose only. People praise Tieck
and Schlegel’s version of Shakspeare. I, for
my part, would sooner read Shakspeare in
the French prose translation, and that is
saying a great deal; but in the German
poets’ hands Shakspeare so often gets,
especially where he is humorous, an air
of what the French call <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>niaiserie</i></span>! and can
anything be more un-Shakspearian than
that? Again; Mr Hayward’s prose translation
of the first part of <i>Faust</i>—so good
that it makes one regret Mr Hayward should
have abandoned the line of translation for
a kind of literature which is, to say the least,
somewhat slight—is not likely to be surpassed
by any translation in verse. But
poems like the <i>Iliad</i>, which, in the main,
are in one manner, may hope to find a
poetical translator so gifted and so trained
as to be able to learn that one manner, and
to reproduce it. Only, the poet who would
reproduce this must cultivate in himself a
Greek virtue by no means common among
the moderns in general, and the English in
particular,—<i>moderation</i>. For Homer has
not only the English vigour, he has the
Greek grace; and when one observes the
bolstering, rollicking way in which his
English admirers—even men of genius like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>the late Professor Wilson—love to talk of
Homer and his poetry, one cannot help
feeling that there is no very deep community
of nature between them and the
object of their enthusiasm. ‘It is very
well, my good friends’, I always imagine
Homer saying to them: if he could hear
them: ‘you do me a great deal of honour,
but somehow or other you praise me too
like barbarians’. For Homer’s grandeur is
not the mixed and turbid grandeur of the
great poets of the north, of the authors of
<i>Othello</i> and <i>Faust</i>; it is a perfect, a lovely
grandeur. Certainly his poetry has all the
energy and power of the poetry of our ruder
climates; but it has, besides, the pure lines
of an Ionian horizon, the liquid clearness
of an Ionian sky.</p>

  <h2 id='reply1' class='c003'>Homeric Translation in Theory and Practice <br /> A Reply to Matthew Arnold <br /> By Francis W. Newman</h2>
</div>
<p class='c004'>It is so difficult, amid the press of literature,
for a mere versifier and translator to gain
notice at all, that an assailant may even do
one a service, if he so conduct his assault
as to enable the reader to sit in intelligent
judgment on the merits of the book assailed.
But when the critic deals out to the readers
only so much knowledge as may propagate
his own contempt of the book, he has undoubtedly
immense power to dissuade them
from wishing to open it. Mr Arnold writes
as openly aiming at this end. He begins by
complimenting me, as ‘a man of great
ability and genuine learning’; but on
questions of learning, as well as of taste,
he puts me down as bluntly, as if he had
meant, ‘a man totally void both of learning
and of sagacity’. He again and again
takes for granted that he has ‘the scholar’
on his side, ‘the living scholar’, the man
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>who has learning and taste without pedantry.
He bids me please ‘the scholars’,
and go to ‘the scholars’ tribunal’; and
does not know that I did this, to the extent
of my opportunity, before committing myself
to a laborious, expensive and perhaps
thankless task. Of course he cannot guess,
what is the fact, that scholars of fastidious
refinement, but of a judgment which I
think far more masculine than Mr Arnold’s,
have passed a most encouraging sentence
on large specimens of my translations. I
at this moment count eight such names,
though of course I must not here adduce
them: nor will I further allude to it, than
to say, that I have no such sense either of
pride or of despondency, as those are liable
to, who are consciously isolated in their
taste.</p>

<p class='c005'>Scholars are the tribunal of Erudition, but
of Taste the educated but unlearned public
is the only rightful judge; and to it I wish
to appeal. Even scholars collectively have
no right, and much less have single scholars,
to pronounce a final sentence on questions
of taste in their court. Where I differ in
Taste from Mr Arnold, it is very difficult
to find ‘the scholars’ tribunal even if I
acknowledged its absolute jurisdiction: but
as regards Erudition, this difficulty does
not occur, and I shall fully reply to the
numerous dogmatisms by which he settles
the case against me.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>But I must first avow to the reader my
own moderate pretensions. Mr Arnold begins
by instilling two errors which he does
not commit himself to assert. He says that
my work will <i>not</i> take rank as <i>the</i> standard
translation of Homer, but <i>other translations
will be made</i>: as if I thought otherwise!
If I have set the example of the right direction
in which translators ought to aim, of
course those who follow me will improve
upon me and supersede me. A man would
be rash indeed to withhold his version of a
poem of fifteen thousand lines, until he had,
to his best ability, imparted to them all
their final perfection. He might spend the
leisure of his life upon it. He would possibly
be in his grave before it could see the
light. If it then were published, and it
was founded on any new principle, there
would be no one to defend it from the
attacks of ignorance and prejudice. In the
nature of the case, his wisdom is to elaborate
in the first instance all the high and noble
parts <i>carefully</i>, and get through the inferior
parts <i>somehow</i>; leaving of necessity very
much to be done in successive editions, if
possibly it please general taste sufficiently
to reach them. A generous and intelligent
critic will test such a work mainly or solely
by the most noble parts, and as to the rest,
will consider whether the metre and style
adapts itself naturally to them also.</p>

<p class='c005'>Next, Mr Arnold asks, ‘Who is to assure
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>Mr Newman, that when he has tried to
retain every peculiarity of his original, he
has done that for which Mr Newman enjoins
this to be done—adhered closely to Homer’s
manner and habit of thought? Evidently
the translator needs more practical directions
than these’. The tendency of this is, to
suggest to the reader that I am not aware
of the difficulty of rightly applying good
principles; whereas I have in this very
connection said expressly, that even when
a translator has got right principles, he is
liable to go wrong in the detail of their
application. This is as true of all the principles
which Mr Arnold can possibly give,
as of those which I have given; nor do I
for a moment assume, that in writing fifteen
thousand lines of verse I have not made
hundreds of blots.</p>

<p class='c005'>At the same time Mr Arnold has overlooked
the point of my remark. Nearly
every translator before me has <i>knowingly</i>,
<i>purposely</i>, <i>habitually</i> shrunk from Homer’s
thoughts and Homer’s manner. The reader
will afterwards see whether Mr Arnold does
not justify them in their course. It is not
for those who are purposely unfaithful to
taunt me with the difficulty of being truly
faithful.</p>

<p class='c005'>I have alleged, and, against Mr Arnold’s
flat denial, I deliberately repeat, that Homer
rises and sinks with his subject, and is often
homely or prosaic. I have professed as my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>principle, to follow my original in this
matter. It is unfair to expect of me
grandeur in trivial passages. If in any
place where Homer is <i>confessedly</i> grand
and noble, I have marred and ruined his
greatness, let me be reproved. But I shall
have occasion to protest, that Stateliness
is not Grandeur, Picturesqueness is not
Stately, Wild Beauty is not to be confounded
with Elegance: a Forest has its
swamps and brushwood, as well as its tall
trees.</p>

<p class='c005'>The duty of one who <i>publishes</i> his censures
on me is, to select noble, greatly admired
passages, and confront me both with
a prose translation of the original (for the
public cannot go to the Greek) and also
with that which he judges to be a more
successful version than mine. Translation
being matter of compromise, and being
certain to fall below the original, when this
is of the highest type of grandeur; the
question is not, What translator is perfect?
but, Who is least imperfect? Hence the
only fair test is by comparison, when comparison
is possible. But Mr Arnold has not
put me to this test. He has quoted two
very short passages, and various single
lines, half lines and single words, from
me; and chooses to <i>tell</i> his readers that I
ruin Homer’s nobleness, when (if his censure
is just) he might make them <i>feel</i> it by
quoting me upon the most admired pieces.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>Now with the warmest sincerity I say: If
any English reader, after perusing my
version of four or five eminently noble
passages of sufficient length, side by side
with those of other translators, and (better
still) with a prose version also, finds in
them high qualities which I have destroyed;
I am foremost to advise him to shut my
book, or to consult it only (as Mr Arnold
suggests) as a schoolboy’s ‘help to construe’,
if such it can be. My sole object
is, to bring Homer before the unlearned
public: I seek no self-glorification: the
sooner I am superseded by a really better
translation, the greater will be my pleasure.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was not until I more closely read Mr
Arnold’s own versions, that I understood
how necessary is his repugnance to mine.
I am unwilling to speak of his metrical
efforts. I shall not say more than my
argument strictly demands. It here suffices
to state the simple fact, that for awhile I
seriously doubted whether he meant his first
specimen for metre at all. He seems distinctly
to say, he is going to give us English
Hexameters; but it was long before I could
believe that he had written the following
for that metre:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>So shone forth, in front of Troy, by the bed of Xanthus,</div>
      <div class='line'>Between that and the ships, the Trojans’ numerous fires.</div>
      <div class='line'>In the plain there were kindled a thousand fires: by each one</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>There sate fifty men, in the ruddy light of the fire.</div>
      <div class='line'>By their chariots stood the steeds, and champ’d the white barley,</div>
      <div class='line'>While their masters sate by the fire, and waited for Morning.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>I sincerely thought, this was meant for
prose; at length the two last lines opened
my eyes. He <i>does</i> mean them for Hexameters!
‘Fire’ ( = feuer) with him is a
spondee or trochee. The first line, I now
see, begins with three (quantitative) spondees,
and is meant to be spondaic in the
fifth foot. ‘Bed of, Between, In the’,—are
meant for spondees! So are ‘There
sate’, ‘<i>By</i> their’; though ‘Troy <i>by</i> the’
was a dactyl. ‘Champ’d the white’ is a
dactyl. My ‘metrical exploits’ amaze Mr
Arnold (<abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 23); but my courage is timidity
itself compared to his.</p>

<p class='c005'>His second specimen stands thus:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>And with pity the son of Saturn saw them bewailing,</div>
      <div class='line'>And he shook his head, and thus address’d his own bosom:</div>
      <div class='line'>Ah, unhappy pair! to Peleus why did we give you,</div>
      <div class='line'>To a mortal? but ye are without old age and immortal.</div>
      <div class='line'>Was it that ye with man, might have your thousands of sorrows?</div>
      <div class='line'>For than man indeed there breathes no wretcheder creature,</div>
      <div class='line'>Of all living things, that on earth are breathing and moving.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>Upon this he apologises for ‘To a’, intended
as a spondee in the fourth line, and ‘-dress’d
his own’ for a dactyl in the second; liberties
which, he admits, go rather far, but ‘do not
actually spoil the run of the hexameter’.
In a note, he attempts to palliate his deeds
by recriminating on Homer, though he will
not allow to me the same excuse. The
accent (it seems) on the second syllable of
αἰόλος makes it as impure a dactyl to a
Greek as ‘death-destin’d’ is to us! Mr
Arnold’s erudition in Greek metres is very
curious, if he can establish that they take
any cognisance <i>at all</i> of the prose accent,
or that <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αἰολος</span> is quantitatively more or less
of a dactyl, according as the prose accent
is on one or other syllable. His ear also
must be of a very unusual kind, if it makes
out that ‘death-destin’d’ is anything but
a downright Molossus. Write it <i>dethdestind</i>,
as it is pronounced, and the eye, equally
with the ear, decides it to be of the same
type as the word <i>persistunt</i>.
In the lines just quoted, most readers will
be slow to believe, that they have to place
an impetus of the voice (an ictus metricus
at least) on Bétween, In´ the, Thére sate,
By´ their, A´nd with, A´nd he, Tó a, Fór
than, O´f all. Here, in the course of thirteen
lines, <i>composed as a specimen of style</i>,
is found the same offence nine times repeated,
to say nothing here of other deformities.
Now contrast Mr Arnold’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>severity against me<a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c009'><sup>[35]</sup></a>, <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> <a href='#Page_87'>87</a>: ‘It is a real
fault when Mr Newman has:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Infátuáte! óh that thou wért | lord to some other army—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>for here the reader is required, not for any
special advantage to himself, but <i>simply to
save Mr Newman trouble</i>, to place the accent
on the insignificant word <i>wert</i>, where it has
<i>no business whatever</i>’. Thus to the flaw
which Mr Arnold admits nine times in
thirteen pattern lines, he shows no mercy
in me, who have toiled through fifteen
thousand. Besides, on <i>wert</i> we are free at
pleasure to place or not to place the accent;
but in Mr Arnold’s <i>Bétween</i>, <i>Tó a</i>, etc., it
is impossible or offensive.</p>

<p class='c005'>To avoid a needlessly personal argument,
I enlarge on the general question of hexameters.
Others, scholars of repute, have
given example and authority to English
hexameters. As matter of curiosity, as
erudite sport, such experiments may have
their value. I do not mean to express
indiscriminate disapproval, much less contempt.
I have myself privately tried the
same in Alcaics; and find the chief objection
to be, not that the task is impossible,
but that to execute it <i>well</i> is too difficult
for a language like ours, overladen with
consonants, and abounding with syllables
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>neither distinctly long nor distinctly short,
but of every intermediate length. Singing
to a tune was essential to keep even Greek
or Roman poetry to true <i>time</i>; to the
English language it is of tenfold necessity.
But if <i>time</i> is abandoned (as in fact it always
is), and the prose accent has to do
duty for the ictus metricus, the moral genius
of the metre is fundamentally subverted.
What previously was steady duplicate time
(‘march-time’, as Professor Blackie calls
it) vacillates between duplicate and triplicate.
With Homer, a dactyl had nothing
in it <i>more tripping</i> than a spondee: a
crotchet followed by two quavers belongs
to as grave an anthem as two crotchets.
But Mr Arnold himself (<abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> <a href='#Page_55'>55</a>) calls the
introduction of anapæsts by Dr Maginn into
our ballad measure, ‘a detestable dance’:
as in:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>

      <div class='line'>And scarcely hád shĕ bĕgún to wash,</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>I will not assert that this is everywhere
improper in the Odyssey; but no part of
the Iliad occurs to me in which it is proper,
and I have totally excluded it in my own
practice. I notice it but once in Mr Gladstone’s
specimens, and it certainly offends
my taste as out of harmony with the gravity
of the rest, viz.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>My ships shall bound ĭn thĕ morning’s light.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>In Shakspeare we have <i>i’th’</i> and <i>o’th’</i> for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>monosyllables, but (so scrupulous am I in
the midst of my ‘atrocities’) I never dream
of such a liberty myself, much less of avowed
‘anapæsts’. So far do I go in the opposite
direction, as to prefer to make such words
as <i>Danai</i>, <i>victory</i> three syllables, which even
Mr Gladstone and Pope accept as dissyllabic.
Some reviewers have called my metre <i>lege
solutum</i>; which is as ridiculous a mistake
as Horace made concerning Pindar. That,
in passing. But surely Mr Arnold’s severe
blow at Dr Maginn rebounds with double
force upon himself.</p>

<p class='c008'>cannot be a <i>less</i> detestable jig than that of
Dr Maginn. And this objection holds
against every accentual hexameter, even
to those of Longfellow or Lockhart, if applied
to grand poetry. For bombast, in a
wild whimsical poem, Mr Clough has proved
it to be highly appropriate; and I think,
the more ‘rollicking’ is Mr Clough (if only
I understand the word) the more successful
his metre. Mr Arnold himself <i>feels</i> what
I say against ‘dactyls’, for on this very
ground he advises largely superseding them
by spondees; and since what he calls a
spondee is any pair of syllables of which the
former is accentuable, his precept amounts
to this, that the hexameter be converted
into a line of six accentual trochees, with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>free liberty left of diversifying it, in any
foot except the last, by Dr Maginn’s ‘detestable
dance’. What more severe condemnation
of the metre is imaginable than
this mere description gives? ‘Six trochees’
seems to me the worst possible foundation
for an English metre. I cannot imagine
that Mr Arnold will give the slightest weight
to this, as a judgment from me; but I do
advise him to search in Samson Agonistes,
Thalaba, Kehama, and Shelley’s works, for
the phenomenon.</p>

<p class='c005'>I have elsewhere insisted, but I here repeat,
that for a long poem a trochaic beginning
of the verse is most unnatural and
vexatious in English, because so large a
number of our sentences begin with unaccented
syllables, and the vigour of a trochaic
line eminently depends on the purity of its
initial trochee. Mr Arnold’s feeble trochees
already quoted (from <i>Bétween</i> to <i>Tó a</i>) are
all the fatal result of defying the tendencies
of our language.</p>

<p class='c005'>If by a happy combination any scholar
could compose fifty <i>such</i> English hexameters,
as would convey a living likeness of the
Virgilian metre, I should applaud it as
valuable for initiating schoolboys into that
metre: but there its utility would end.
The method could not be profitably used for
translating Homer or Virgil, plainly because
it is impossible to say for whose service such
a translation would be executed. Those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>who can read the original will never care to
read <i>through</i> any translation; and the unlearned
look on all, even the best hexameters,
whether from Southey, Lockhart or Longfellow,
as odd and disagreeable prose. Mr
Arnold deprecates appeal to popular taste:
well he may! yet if the unlearned are to
be our audience, we cannot defy them. I
myself, before venturing to print, sought
to ascertain how unlearned women and
children would accept my verses. I could
boast how children and half-educated women
have extolled them; how greedily a working
man has inquired for them, without knowing
who was the translator; but I well know
that this is quite insufficient to establish the
merits of a translation. It is nevertheless <i>one</i>
point. ‘Homer is popular’, is one of the
very few matters of fact in this controversy
on which Mr Arnold and I are agreed.
‘English hexameters are not popular’, is
a truth so obvious, that I do not yet believe
he will deny it. Therefore, ‘Hexameters
are not the metre for translating Homer’.
<abbr class='spell'>Q. E. D.</abbr></p>

<p class='c005'>I cannot but think that the very respectable
scholars who pertinaciously adhere to
the notion that English hexameters have
something ‘epical’ in them, have no vivid
<i>feeling</i> of the difference between Accent and
Quantity: and this is the less wonderful,
since so very few persons have ever actually
<i>heard</i> quantitative verse. I have; by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>listening to Hungarian poems, read to me
by my friend Mr Francis Pulszky, a native
Magyar. He had not finished a single page,
before I complained gravely of the monotony.
He replied: ‘So do <i>we</i> complain of
it’: and then showed me, by turning the
pages, that the poet cut the knot which he
could not untie, by frequent changes of his
metre. Whether it was a change of mere
length, as from Iambic senarian to Iambic
dimeter; or implied a fundamental change
of time, as in music from <i>common</i> to <i>minuet</i>
time; I cannot say. But, to my ear,
nothing but a tune can ever save a quantitative
metre from hideous monotony. It is
like strumming a piece of very simple music
on a single note. Nor only so; but the most
beautiful of anthems, after it has been repeated
a hundred times on a hundred successive
verses, begins to pall on the ear.
How much more would an entire book of
Homer, if chanted at one sitting! I have
the conviction, though I will not undertake
to impart it to another, that if the living
Homer could sing his lines to us, they would
at first move in us the same pleasing interest
as an elegant and simple melody from an
African of the Gold Coast; but that, after
hearing twenty lines, we should complain
of meagreness, sameness, and <i>loss of moral
expression</i>; and should judge the style to
be <i>as</i> inferior to our own oratorical metres,
as the music of Pindar to our third-rate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>modern music. But if the poet, at our request,
instead of singing the verses, read or
spoke them, then from the loss of well-marked
time and the ascendency reassumed
by the prose-accent, we should be as helplessly
unable to <i>hear</i> any metre in them, as
are the modern Greeks.</p>

<p class='c005'>I expect that Mr Arnold will reply to this,
that he <i>reads</i> and does not <i>sing</i> Homer, and
yet he finds his verses to be melodious and
not monotonous. To this, I retort, that he
begins by wilfully pronouncing Greek falsely,
according to the laws of <i>Latin</i> accent, and
artificially assimilating the Homeric to the
Virgilian line. Virgil has compromised between
the ictus metricus and the prose
accent, by exacting that the two coincide
in the two last feet and generally forbidding
it in the second and third foot. What is
called the ‘feminine cæsura’ gives (in the
Latin language) coincidence on the third
foot. Our extreme familiarity with these
laws of compromise enables us to anticipate
recurring sounds and satisfies our ear. But
the Greek prose accent, by reason of oxytons
and paroxytons, and accent on the ante-penultima
in spite of a long penultima,
totally resists all such compromise; and
proves that particular form of melody,
which our scholars enjoy in Homer, to be
an unhistoric imitation of Virgil.</p>

<p class='c005'>I am aware, there is a bold theory,
whispered if not published, that,—so out-and-out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span><i>Æolian</i> was Homer,—his laws of
accent must have been almost Latin. According
to this, Erasmus, following the track
of Virgil blindly, has taught us to pronounce
Euripides and Plato ridiculously ill, but
Homer, with an accuracy of accent which
puts Aristarchus to shame. This is no place
for discussing so difficult a question. Suffice
it to say, <i>first</i>, that Mr Arnold cannot take
refuge in such a theory, since he does not
admit that Homer was antiquated to Euripides;
<i>next</i>, that admitting the theory to
him, still the loss of the Digamma destroys
to him the true rhythm of Homer. I shall
recur to both questions below. I here add,
that our English pronunciation even of Virgil
often so ruins Virgil’s own <i>quantities</i>, that
there is something either of delusion or of
pedantry in our scholars’ self-complacency
in the rhythm which they elicit.</p>

<p class='c005'>I think it fortunate for Mr Arnold, that
he had <i>not</i> ‘courage to translate Homer’;
for he must have failed to make it acceptable
to the unlearned. But if the public ear
prefers ballad metres, still (Mr Arnold assumes)
‘the scholar’ is with him in this
whole controversy. Nevertheless it gradually
comes out that neither is this the case,
but he himself is in the minority. P. <a href='#Page_110'>110</a>,
he writes: ‘When one observes the
boistering, rollicking way in which Homer’s
English admirers—even men of genius, like
the late Professor Wilson—love to talk of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>Homer and his poetry, one cannot help
feeling that there is no very deep community
of nature between them and the
object of their enthusiasm.’ It does not
occur to Mr Arnold that the defect of perception
lies with himself, and that Homer
has more sides than he has discovered. He
deplores that Dr Maginn, and others whom
he names, err with me, in believing that
our ballad-style is the nearest approximation
to that of Homer; and avows that ‘<i>it is
time to say plainly</i>’ (<abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> <a href='#Page_46'>46</a>) that Homer is
not of the ballad-type. So in <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> <a href='#Page_45'>45</a>, ‘—this
<i>popular</i>, but, <i>it is time to say</i>, this erroneous
analogy’ between the ballad and Homer.
Since it is reserved for Mr Arnold to turn
the tide of opinion; since it is a task not
yet achieved, but remains to be achieved by
his authoritative enunciation; he confesses
that hitherto I have with me the suffrage of
scholars. With this confession, a little more
diffidence would be becoming, if diffidence
were possible to the fanaticism with which
he idolises hexameters. P. <a href='#Page_88'>88</a>, he says:
‘The hexameter has a natural dignity,
which repels both the jaunty style and the
jog-trot style, etc.... <i>The translator who uses
it cannot too religiously follow the</i> <span class='fss'>INSPIRATION
OF HIS METRE</span>’ etc. Inspiration from a metre
which has no recognised type? from a
metre which the <i>heart</i> and <i>soul</i> of the nation
ignores? I believe, if the metre can inspire
anything, it is to frolic and gambol
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>with Mr Clough. Mr Arnold’s English hexameter
cannot be a higher inspiration to him,
than the true hexameter was to a Greek:
yet that metre inspired strains of totally
different essential genius and merit.</p>

<p class='c005'>But I claim Mr Arnold himself as confessing
that our ballad <i>metre</i> is epical, when
he says that Scott is ‘<i>bastard</i>-epic’. I do
not admit that his quotations from Scott
are all Scott’s best, nor anything like it;
but if they were, it would only prove something
against Scott’s genius or talent,
nothing about his metre. The Κύπρια ἔπη
or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἰλίου πέρσις</span> were probably very inferior
to the Iliad; but no one would on
that account call them or the Frogs and
Mice bastard-epic. No one would call a
bad tale of Dryden or of Crabbe bastard-epic.
The application of the word to Scott virtually
concedes what I assert. Mr Arnold also calls
Macaulay’s ballads ‘pinchbeck’; but a man
needs to produce something very noble himself,
before he can afford thus to sneer at
Macaulay’s ‘Lars Porsena’.</p>

<p class='c005'>Before I enter on my own ‘metrical exploits’,
I must get rid of a disagreeable
topic. Mr Arnold’s repugnance to them has
led him into forms of attack, which I do not
know how to characterize. I shall state my
complaints as concisely as I can, and so
leave them.</p>

<p class='c005'>1. I do not seek for any similarity of
<i>sound</i> in an English accentual metre to that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>of a Greek quantitative metre; besides that
Homer writes in a highly vocalized tongue,
while ours is overfilled with consonants. I
have disowned this notion of similar rhythm
in the strongest terms (<abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> <abbr title='17'>xvii</abbr> of my Preface),
expressly because some critics had
imputed this aim to me in the case of
Horace. I summed up: ‘It is not audible
sameness of metre, but a likeness of moral
genius which is to be aimed at’. I contrast
the audible to the moral. Mr Arnold suppresses
this contrast, and writes as follows,
<abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 34. Mr Newman tells us that he has
found a metre like in moral genius to
Homer’s. His judge has still the same
answer: reproduce <span class='fss'>THEN</span> <i>on our ear</i> something
of ‘the effect produced by the <i>movement</i>
of Homer’. He recurs to the same
fallacy in <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 57. ‘For whose <span class='fss'>EAR</span> do those
two <i>rhythms</i> produce impressions of (<i>to use
Mr Newman’s own words</i>) “similar moral
genius”’? His reader will naturally suppose
that ‘like in moral genius’ is with me
an eccentric phrase for ‘like in musical
cadence’. The only likeness to the ear
which I have admitted, is, that the one and
the other are primitively made <i>for music</i>.
That, Mr Arnold knows, is a matter of fact,
whether a ballad be well or ill written. If
he pleases, he may hold the rhythm of our
metre to be necessarily inferior to Homer’s
and to his own; but when I fully explained
in my preface what were my tests of ‘like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>moral genius’, I cannot understand his suppressing
them, and perverting the sense of
my words.</p>

<p class='c005'>2. In <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> <a href='#Page_52'>52</a>, Mr Arnold quotes Chapman’s
translation of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἆ δείλω</span>, ‘Poor wretched
<i>beasts</i>’ (of Achilles’ horses), on which he
comments severely. He does <i>not</i> quote me.
Yet in <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> <a href='#Page_100'>100</a>, after exhibiting Cowper’s
translation of the same passage, he adds:
‘There is no want of dignity here, as in the
versions of Chapman and of <i>Mr Newman,
which I have already quoted</i>’. Thus he leads
the reader to believe that I have the same
phrase as Chapman! In fact, my translation
is:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Ha! why on Peleus, mortal prince,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Bestowed we <i>you</i>, unhappy!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>If he had done me the justice of quoting,
it is possible that some readers would not
have thought my rendering intrinsically
‘wanting in dignity’, or less noble than
Mr Arnold’s own, which is:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Ah! unhappy pair! to Peleus<a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c009'><sup>[36]</sup></a> why did we give you,</div>
      <div class='line'>To a mortal?</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>In <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> <a href='#Page_52'>52</a>, he with very gratuitous insult
remarks, that ‘Poor wretched beasts’ is
a little over-familiar; but this is no objection
to it for the ballad-manner<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c009'><sup>[37]</sup></a>: <i>it is good
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>enough</i> ... <i>for Mr Newman’s Iliad</i>, ...
etc.’ Yet I myself have <i>not</i> thought it
good enough for my Iliad.</p>

<p class='c005'>3. In <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> <a href='#Page_107'>107</a>, Mr Arnold gives his own
translation of the discourse between Achilles
and his horse; and prefaces it with the
words, ‘I will take the passage in which
both Chapman and Mr Newman <i>have already
so much excited our astonishment</i>’.
But he did not quote my translation of the
noble part of the passage, consisting of 19
lines; he has merely quoted<a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c009'><sup>[38]</sup></a> the tail of
it, 5 lines; which are altogether inferior.
Of this a sufficient indication is, that Mr
Gladstone has translated the 19 and omitted
the 5. I shall below give my translation
parallel to Mr Gladstone’s. The curious
reader may compare it with Mr Arnold’s,
if he choose.</p>

<p class='c005'>4. In <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> <a href='#Page_102'>102</a>, Mr Arnold quotes from
Chapman as a translation of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὅταν ποτ’ ὀλώλῃ
Ιλιος ἱρὴ</span>,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘When sacred Troy shall <i>shed her tow’rs for tears of overthrow</i>’;</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>and adds: ‘What Mr Newman’s manner
of rendering would be, you can by this
time sufficiently imagine for yourselves’.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span><i>Would be!</i> Why does he set his readers to
‘imagine’, when in fewer words he could
tell them what my version <i>is</i>? It stands
thus:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>A day, when sacred Ilium | for overthrow is destin’d,—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>which may have faults unperceived by me,
but is in my opinion far better than Mr
Arnold’s, and certainly did not deserve to
be censured side by side with Chapman’s
absurdity. I must say plainly; a critic
has no right to hide what I have written,
and stimulate his readers to despise me
by these <i>indirect</i> methods.</p>

<p class='c005'>I proceed to my own metre. It is exhibited
in this stanza of Campbell:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>By this the storm grew loud apace:</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The waterwraith was shrieking,</div>
      <div class='line'>And in the scowl of heav’n each face</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Grew dark as they were speaking.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Whether I use this metre well or ill, I maintain
that it is essentially a noble metre, a
popular metre, a metre of great capacity.
<i>It is essentially the national ballad metre</i>,
for the double rhyme is an accident. Of
<i>course</i> it can be applied to low, as well as
to high subjects; else it would <i>not</i> be
popular: it would <i>not</i> be ‘of a like moral
genius’ to the Homeric metre, which was
available equally for the comic poem
<i>Margites</i>, for the precepts of Pythagoras,
for the pious prosaic hymn of Cleanthes,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>for the driest prose of a naval catalogue<a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c009'><sup>[39]</sup></a>,
in short, <i>for all early thought</i>. Mr Arnold
appears to forget, though he cannot be ignorant,
that prose-composition is later than
Homer, and that in the epical days every
initial effort at prose history was carried
on in <i>Homeric doggerel</i> by the Cyclic poets,
who traced the history of Troy <i>ab ovo</i> in
consecutive chronology. I say, he is merely
inadvertent, he cannot be ignorant, that the
Homeric <i>metre</i>, like my metre, subserves
prosaic thought with the utmost facility;
but I hold it to be, not indavertence, but
blindness, when he does not see that Homer’s
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τὸν δ’ ἀπαμειβόμενος</span> is a line of as thoroughly
unaffected <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>oratio pedestris</i></span> as any
verse of Pythagoras or Horace’s Satires.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>But on diction I defer to speak, till I have
finished the topic of metre.</p>

<p class='c005'>I do not say that any measure is faultless.
Every measure has its foible: mine
has that fault which every uniform line
must have; it is liable to monotony. This
is evaded of course, as in the hexameter or
rather as in Milton’s line, first, by varying
the cæsura, secondly, by varying certain
feet, within narrow and well understood
limits, thirdly, by irregularity in the strength
of accents, fourthly, by varying the weight
of the unaccented syllables also. All these
things are needed, <i>for the mere sake of
breaking uniformity</i>. I will not here assert
that Homer’s many marvellous freedoms,
such as <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἑκηβόλου Ἀπόλλωνος</span>, were dictated
by this aim, like those in the <i>Paradise
Lost</i>; but I do say, that it is most unjust,
most unintelligent, in critics, to produce
<i>single</i> lines from me, and criticize them
as rough or weak, instead of examining them
and presenting them as part of <i>a mass</i>.
How would Shakspeare stand this sort of
test? nay, or Milton? The metrical laws
of a long poem cannot be the same as of a
sonnet: single verses are organic elements
of a great whole. A crag must not be cut
like a gem. Mr Arnold should remember
Aristotle’s maxim, that popular eloquence
(and such is Homer’s) should be broad,
rough and highly coloured, like scene painting,
not polished into delicacy like miniature.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>But I speak now of metre, not yet of diction.
In <i>any</i> long and popular poem it is a mistake
to wish every line to conform severely
to a few types; but to claim this of a translator
of <i>Homer</i> is a doubly unintelligent
exaction, when Homer’s own liberties transgress
all bounds; many of them being feebly
disguised by later double spellings, as <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">εἵως,
εἷος</span>, invented for his special accommodation.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Homeric verse has a rhythmical advantage
over mine in less rigidity of cæsura.
Though the Hexameter was made out of
two Doric lines, yet no division of sense,
no pause of the voice or thought, is exacted
between them. The chasm between two
English verses is deeper. Perhaps, on the
side of syntax, a <i>four + three</i> English metre
drives harder towards monotony than
Homer’s own verse. For other reasons,
it lies under a like disadvantage, compared
with Milton’s metre. The secondary
cæsuras possible in the four feet are of
course less numerous than those in the five
feet, and the three-foot verse has still less
variety. To my taste, it is far more pleasing
that the short line recur less regularly; just
as the parœmiac of Greek anapæsts is less
pleasant in the Aristophanic tetrameter, than
when it comes frequent but not expected.
This is a main reason why I prefer Scott’s
free metre to my own; yet, without rhyme,
I have not found how to use his freedom.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>Mr Arnold wrongly supposes me to have
overlooked his main and just objections to
rhyming Homer; viz. that so many Homeric
lines are intrinsically made for isolation.
In <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> <abbr title='9'>ix</abbr> of my Preface I called it a fatal
embarrassment. But the objection applies
in its full strength only against Pope’s
rhymes, not against Walter Scott’s.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mr Gladstone has now laid before the
public his own specimens of Homeric translation.
Their dates range from 1836 to
1859. It is possible that he has as strong
a distaste as Mr Arnold for my version;
for he totally ignores the archaic, the rugged,
the boisterous element in Homer. But as
to metre, he gives me his full suffrage. He
has lines with four accents, with three, and
a few with two; not one with five. On the
whole, his metre, his cadences, his varying
rhymes, are those of Scott. He has more
trochaic lines than I approve. He is truthful
to Homer on many sides; and (such is
the delicate grace and variety admitted by
the rhyme) his verses are more pleasing than
mine. I do not hesitate to say, that if <i>all</i>
Homer could be put before the public in the
same style equally well with his best pieces,
a translation executed on my principles
could not live in the market at its side;
and certainly I should spare my labour.
I add, that I myself prefer the former piece
which I quote to my own, even while I see
his defects: for I hold that his graces, at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>which I cannot afford to aim, more than
make up for his losses. After this confession,
I frankly contrast his rendering of
the two noblest passages with mine, that the
reader may see, what Mr Arnold does not
show, my weak and strong sides.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now if any fool ask, Why does not Mr
Gladstone translate <i>all</i> Homer? any fool
can reply with me, Because he is Chancellor
of the Exchequer. A man who has talents
and acquirements adequate to translate
Homer <i>well</i> into <i>rhyme</i>, is almost certain
to have other far more urgent calls for the
exercise of such talents.</p>

<p class='c005'>So much of metre. At length I come to
the topic of Diction, where Mr Arnold and
I are at variance not only as to taste, but
as to the main facts of Greek literature.
I had called Homer’s style quaint and garrulous;
and said that he rises and falls
with his subject, being prosaic when it is
tame, and low when it is mean. I added
no proof; for I did not dream that it was
needed. Mr Arnold not only absolutely
denies all this, and denies it without proof;
but adds, that these assertions prove my
incompetence, and account for my total
and conspicuous failure. His whole attack
upon my diction is grounded on a passage
which I must quote at length; for it is so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>confused in logic, that I may otherwise be
thought to garble it, <abbr title='pages'>pp.</abbr> <a href='#Page_36'>36</a>, <a href='#Page_37'>37</a>.</p>

<p class='c005'>‘Mr Newman speaks of the more antiquated
style suited to this subject. Quaint!
Antiquated! but to whom? Sir Thomas
Browne is quaint, and the diction of Chaucer
is antiquated: does Mr Newman suppose
that Homer seemed quaint to Sophocles,
as Chaucer’s diction seems antiquated to
us? But we cannot really know, I confess
(!!), how Homer seemed to Sophocles. Well
then, to those who can tell us how he seems
to them, to the living scholar, to our only
present witness on this matter—does Homer
make on the Provost of Eton, when he reads
him, the impression of a poet quaint and
antiquated! does he make this impression
on Professor Thompson or Professor Jowett?
When Shakspeare says, “The Princes orgulous”,
meaning “the proud princes”,
we say, “This is antiquated”. When he
says of the Trojan gates, that they,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in14'>With massy staples</div>
      <div class='line'>And corresponsive and fulfilling bolts</div>
      <div class='line'><i>Sperr</i> up the sons of Troy,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>we say, “This is both quaint and antiquated”.
But does Homer ever compose in a language,
which produces on the scholar at all the
same impression as this language which I
have quoted from Shakspeare? Never
once. Shakspeare is quaint and antiquated
in the lines I have just quoted; but Shakspeare,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>need I say it? can compose, when
he likes, when he is at his best, in a language
perfectly simple, perfectly intelligible; in
a language, which, in spite of the two centuries
and a half which part its author from us,
stops or surprises us as little as the language
of a contemporary. And Homer has not
Shakspeare’s variations. Homer always
composes, as Shakspeare composes at his
best. Homer is always simple and intelligible,
as Shakspeare is often; Homer is
never quaint and antiquated, as Shakspeare
is sometimes’.</p>

<p class='c005'>If Mr Arnold were to lay before none
but Oxford students assertions concerning
Greek literature so startlingly erroneous as
are here contained, it would not concern me to
refute or protest against them. The young
men who read Homer and Sophocles and
Thucydides, nay, the boys who read Homer
and Xenophon, would know his statements to
be against the most notorious and elementary
fact: and the Professors, whom he quotes,
would only lose credit, if they sanctioned the
use he makes of their names. But when he
publishes the book for the unlearned in
Greek, among whom I must include a great
number of editors of magazines, I find Mr
Arnold to do a public wrong to literature,
and a private wrong to my book. If I am
silent, such editors may easily believe that
I have made an enormous blunder in treating
the dialect of Homer as antiquated. If
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>those who are ostensibly scholars, thus assail
my version, and the great majority of
magazines and reviews ignore it, its existence
can never become known to the public;
or it will exist not to be read, but to be
despised without being opened; and it
must perish as many meritorious books
perish. I but lately picked up, new, and
for a fraction of its price, at a second-hand
stall, a translation of the Iliad by <abbr class='spell'>T. S.</abbr>
Brandreth, Esq. (Pickering, London), into
Cowper’s metre, which is, as I judge, immensely
superior to Cowper. Its date is
1846: I had never heard of it. It seems
to have perished uncriticized, unreproved,
unwept, unknown. I do not wish my
progeny to die of neglect, though I am
willing that it should be slain in battle.
However, just because I address myself to
the public <i>unlearned</i> in Greek, and because
Mr Arnold lays before <i>them</i> a new, paradoxical,
monstrously erroneous representation
of facts, with the avowed object of staying the
plague of my Homer; I am forced to reply
to him.</p>

<p class='c005'>Knowingly or unknowingly, he leads his
readers to confuse four different questions:
1. whether Homer is thoroughly intelligible
to modern scholars; 2. whether Homer was
antiquated to the Athenians of Themistocles
and Pericles; 3. whether he was thoroughly
understood by them; 4. whether he is,
absolutely, an antique poet.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>I feel it rather odd, that Mr Arnold begins
by complimenting me with ‘genuine learning’,
and proceeds to appeal from me to
the ‘living scholar’. (What if I were
bluntly to reply: ‘Well! I am the living
scholar’?) After starting the question,
how Homer’s style appeared to Sophocles,
he suddenly enters a plea, under form of a
concession [‘I confess’!], as a pretence for
carrying the cause into a new court, that
of the Provost of Eton and two Professors,
into which court I have no admission; and
then, of his own will, pronounces a sentence
in the name of these learned men. Whether
they are pleased with this parading of their
name in behalf of paradoxical error, I may
well doubt: and until they indorse it themselves,
I shall treat Mr Arnold’s process as a
piece of forgery. But, be this as it may, I
cannot allow him to ‘confess’ for me against
me: let him confess for himself that he does
not know, and not for me, who know perfectly
well, whether Homer seemed quaint
or antiquated to Sophocles. Of course he
did, as every beginner must know. Why,
if I were to write <i>mon</i> for <i>man</i>, <i>londis</i> for
<i>lands</i>, <i>nesties</i> for <i>nests</i>, <i>libbard</i> for <i>leopard</i>,
<i>muchel</i> for <i>much</i>, <i>nap</i> for <i>snap</i>, <i>green-wood
shaw</i> for <i>greenwood shade</i>, Mr Arnold would
call me antiquated, although every word
would be intelligible. Can he possibly be
ignorant, that this exhibits but the smallest
part of the chasm which separates the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>Homeric dialect not merely from the Attic
prose, but from Æschylus when he borrows
most from Homer? Every sentence of
Homer was more or less antiquated to
Sophocles, who could no more help feeling
at every instant the foreign and antiquated
character of the poetry, than an Englishman
can help feeling the same in reading Burns’
poems. Would <i>mon</i>, <i>londis</i>, <i>libbard</i>, <i>withouten</i>,
<i>muchel</i> be antiquated or foreign, and

strange words, as <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀκὴν, χώομαι, βιὸς, κῆλα,
μέμβλωκε, γέντο, πέπον</span>, etc. etc. Finally
comes a goodly lot of words which to this
day are most uncertain in sense. My
learned colleague Mr Malden has printed a
paper on Homeric words, misunderstood
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>by the later poets. Buttmann has written
an octavo volume (I have the English
translation, <i>containing 548 pages</i>) to discuss
106 ill-explained Homeric words. Some
of these Sophocles may have understood,
though we do not; but even if so,
they were not the less antiquated to him.
If there has been any perfect traditional
understanding of Homer, we should not need
to deal with so many words by elaborate
argument. On the face of the Iliad alone
every learner must know how many difficult
adjectives occur: I write down on the spur
of the moment and without reference, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κρήγυον,
ἀργὸς, ἀδινὸς, ἄητος, αἴητος, νώροψ, ἦνοψ,
εἰλίποδες, ἕλιξ, ἑλικῶπες, ἔλλοπες, μέροπες,
ἠλίβατος, ἠλέκτωρ, αἰγίλιψ, σιγαλόεις, ἰόμωρος,
ἐγχεσίμωρος, πέπονες, ἠθεῖος</span>. If Mr Arnold
thought himself wiser than all the world of
Greek scholars, he would not appeal to
them, but would surely enlighten us all: he
would tell me, for instance, what <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἔλλοπες</span>
means, which Liddell and Scott do not
pretend to understand; or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἠθεῖος</span>, of which
they give three different explanations. But
he does not write as claiming an independent
opinion, when he flatly opposes me
and sets me down; he does but use surreptitiously
the name of the ‘living scholar’
against me.</p>

<p class='c005'>But I have only begun to describe the
marked chasm often separating Homer’s
dialect from everything Attic. It has a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>wide diversity of grammatical inflections,
far beyond such vowel changes of dialect
as answer to our provincial pronunciations.
This begins with new case-endings to the
nouns; in -θι, -θεν, -δε, -φι, proceeds to
very peculiar pronominal forms, and then
to strange or irregular verbal inflections,
infinitives in -μεν, -μεναι, imperfects in
-εσκε, presents in -αθω, and an immensity
of strange adverbs and conjunctions. In
Thiersch’s Greek Grammar, after the Accidence
of common Greek is added as supplement
an Homeric Grammar: and in it the
Homeric Noun and Verb occupy (in the
English Translation) 206 octavo pages.
Who ever heard of a Spenserian Grammar?
How many pages could be needed to explain
Chaucer’s grammatical deviations
from modern English? The bare fact of
Thiersch having written so copious a grammar
will enable even the unlearned to understand
the monstrous misrepresentation of
Homer’s dialect, on which Mr Arnold has
based his condemnation of my Homeric
diction. Not wishing to face the plain and
undeniable facts which I have here recounted,
Mr Arnold makes a ‘confession’
that we know nothing about them! and
then appeals to three learned men whether
Homer is antiquated to <i>them</i>; and expounds
this to mean, <i>intelligible to them</i>! Well:
if they have learned <i>modern</i> Greek, of course
they may understand it; but Attic Greek
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>alone will not teach it to them. Neither
will it teach them <i>Homer’s</i> Greek. The
difference of the two is in some directions
so vast, that they may deserve to be called
two languages as much as Portuguese and
Spanish.</p>

<p class='c005'>Much as I have written, a large side of
the argument remains still untouched. The
orthography of Homer was revolutionized
in adapting it to Hellenic use, and in the
process not only were the grammatical
forms tampered with, but at least one consonant
was suppressed. I am sure Mr
Arnold has heard of the Digamma, though
he does not see it in the current Homeric
text. By the re-establishment of this letter,
no small addition would be made to the
‘oddity’ of the sound to the ears of Sophocles.
That the unlearned in Greek may
understand this, I add, that what with us
is written <i>eoika</i>, <i>oikon</i>, <i>oinos</i>, <i>hekas</i>, <i>eorga</i>,
<i>eeipe</i>, <i>eleli</i>χθη, were with the poet <i>wewoika</i>,
<i>wīkon</i>, <i>wīnos</i>, <i>wekas</i> (or <i>swekas</i>?), <i>weworga</i>,
<i>eweipe</i>, <i>eweli</i>χθη<a id='r42' /><a href='#f42' class='c009'><sup>[42]</sup></a>; and so with very many
other words, in which either the metre or the
grammatical formation helps us to detect
a lost consonant, and the analogy of other
dialects or languages assures us that it is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span><i>w</i> which has been lost. Nor is this all;
but in certain words <i>sw</i> seems to have
vanished. What in our text is <i>hoi</i>, <i>heos</i>,
<i>hekuros</i>, were probably <i>woi</i> and <i>swoi</i>, <i>weos</i>
and <i>sweos</i>, <i>swekuros</i>. Moreover the received
spelling of many other words is
corrupt: for instance, <i>deos</i>, <i>deidoika</i>,
<i>eddeisen</i>, <i>periddeisas</i>, <i>addees</i>. The true root
must have had the form <i>dwe</i> or <i>dre</i> or <i>dhe</i>.
That the consonant lost was really <i>w</i>, is
asserted by Benfey from the Sanscrit <i>dvish</i>.
Hence the true forms are <i>dweos</i>, <i>dedwoika</i>,
<i>edweisen</i>, etc.... Next, the initial <i>l</i> of
Homer had in some words a stronger pronunciation,
whether λλ or χλ, as in <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λλιταὶ,
λλίσσομαι, λλωτὸς, λλιτανεύω</span>. I have met
with the opinion that the consonant lost in
<i>anax</i> is not <i>w</i> but <i>k</i>; and that Homer’s
<i>kanax</i> is connected with English <i>king</i>. The
relations of <i>wergon</i>, <i>weworga</i>, <i>wrexai</i>, to
English <i>work</i> and <i>wrought</i> must strike everyone;
but I do not here press the phenomena
of the Homeric <i>r</i> (although it became <i>br</i> in
strong Æolism), because they do not differ
from those in Attic. The Attic forms <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">εἴληφα,
εἴλεγμαι</span> for <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λέληφα</span>, etc., point to
a time when the initial λ of the roots
was a double letter. A root λλαβ would
explain Homer’s ἔλλαβε. If λλ<a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c009'><sup>[43]</sup></a> approached
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>to its Welsh sound, that is, to χλ,
it is not wonderful that such a pronunciation
as <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">οφρᾰ λλαβωμεν</span> was possible: but it is
singular that the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὕδατι χλιαρῷ</span> of Attic is
written <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λιαρῷ</span> in our Homeric text, though
the metre needs a double consonant. Such
phenomena as <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χλιαρὸς</span> and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λιαρὸς, εἴβω</span>
and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λειβω, ἴα</span> and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μία, εἴμαρμαι</span> and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἔμμορε,
αἶα</span> and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γαῖα, γέντο</span> for <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἕλετο, ἰωκὴ</span> and
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἴωξις</span> with <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">διώκω</span>, need to be reconsidered
in connection. The <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">εἰς ἅλα ἇλτο</span> of our
Homer was perhaps <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">εἰς ἅλα σάλλτο</span>: when
λλ was changed into λ, they compensated
by circumflexing the vowel. I might add
the query, Is it so certain that his <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θεαων</span>
was θ<i>eāwōn</i>, and not θ<i>eārōn</i>, analogous to
Latin <i>dearum</i>? But dropping here everything
that has the slightest uncertainty,
the mere restoration of the <i>w</i> where it is
most necessary, makes a startling addition
to the antiquated sound of the Homeric
text. The reciters of Homer in Athens
must have dropped the <i>w</i>, since it is never
written. Nor indeed would Sophocles have
introduced in his <i>Trachiniæ</i>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἁ δέ οἱ φίλα
δάμαρ</span> ... leaving a hiatus most offensive
to the Attics, in mere imitation of
Homer, if he had been accustomed to hear
from the reciters, <i>de woi</i> or <i>de swoi</i>. In
other words also, as in <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">οὐλόμενος</span> for <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὀλόμενος</span>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>later poets have slavishly followed
Homer into irregularities suggested by his
peculiar metre. Whether Homer’s <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ᾱθανατος,
αμμορος</span> ... rose out of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ανθάνατος, ἄνμορος</span>
... is wholly unimportant when we remember
his <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ᾱπόλλωνος</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'>But this leads to remark on the acuteness
of Mr Arnold’s ear. I need not ask whether
he recites the Α differently in <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἆρες, Ἄρες,</span>
and in, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ᾰπόλλων Ᾱπολλωνος</span>. He will not
allow anything antiquated in Homer; and
therefore it is certain that he recites,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αιδοιος τε μοι εσσι, φιλε εκυρε, δεινος τε</span></div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>as they are printed, and admires the rhythm.
When he endures with exemplary patience
such hiatuses, such dactyls as <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἑεκυ, ουδεε</span>,
such a spondee as <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ρε δει</span>, I can hardly
wonder at his complacency in his own
spondees “Between,” “To a.” He finds
nothing wrong in <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">και πεδια λωτευντα</span> or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πολλα
λισσομενη</span>. But Homer sang,</p>

    </div>
  </div>

<p class='c008'>Mr Arnold is not satisfied with destroying
Quantity alone. After theoretically substituting
Accent for it in his hexameters,
he robs us of Accent also; and presents to
us the syllables “to a,” <i>both short</i> and <i>both
necessarily unaccented</i>, for a Spondee, in a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>pattern piece seven lines long, and with an
express and gratuitous remark, that in
using ‘to a’ for a Spondee, he has perhaps
relied too much on accent. I hold up these
phenomena in Mr Arnold as a warning to
all scholars, of the pit of delusion into which
they will fall, if they allow themselves to
talk fine about the ‘Homeric rhythm’ <i>as
now heard</i>, and the duty of a translator
to reproduce something of it.</p>

<p class='c005'>It is not merely the sound and the metre
of Homer, which are impaired by the loss
of his radical <i>w</i>; in extreme cases the sense
also is confused. Thus if a scholar be asked,
what is the meaning of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐείσατο</span> in the Iliad?
he will have to reply: If it stands for
<i>eweisato</i>, it means, ‘he was like’, and is
related to the English root <i>wis</i> and <i>wit</i>,
<abbr title='germanic'>Germ.</abbr> <i>wiss</i>, <abbr title='latin'>Lat.</abbr> <i>vid</i>; but it may also mean
‘he went’—a very eccentric Homerism,—in
which case we should perhaps write it
<i>eyeisato</i>, as in old English we have <i>he yode</i>
or <i>yede</i> instead of <i>he goed</i>, <i>gaed</i>, since too
the current root in Greek and Latin <i>i</i> (go)
may be accepted as <i>ye</i>, answering to German
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><i>geh</i></span>, English <i>go</i>. Thus two words, <i>eweisato</i>,
‘he was like’, <i>eyeisato</i>, ‘he went’, are
confounded in our text. I will add, that
in the Homeric</p>

<p class='c010'>—<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἤϋτε wέθνεα (<i>y</i>)εῖσι</span>—(<abbr title='iliad'><i>Il.</i></abbr> 2, 87)</p>

<p class='c011'>—<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">διὰ πρὸ δὲ (<i>y</i>)είσατο καὶ τῆς</span> (<abbr title='iliad'><i>Il.</i></abbr> 4, 138)</p>

<p class='c008'><i>my</i> ear misses the consonant, though Mr
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>Arnold’s (it seems) does not. If we were
ordered to read <i>dat ting</i> in Chaucer for <i>that
thing</i>, it would at first ‘surprise’ us as
‘grotesque’, but after this objection had
vanished, we should still feel it ‘antiquated’.
The confusion of <i>thick</i> and <i>tick</i>, <i>thread</i> and
<i>tread</i>, may illustrate the possible effect of
dropping the <i>w</i> in Homer. I observe that
Benfey’s Greek Root Lexicon has a list of
454 digammated words, most of which
are Homeric. But it is quite needless to
press the argument to its full.</p>

<p class='c005'>If as much learning had been spent on
the double λ and on the <i>y</i> and <i>h</i> of Homer,
as on the digamma, it might perhaps now
be conceded that we have lost, not one,
but three or four consonants from his text.
That λ in <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λύω</span> or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λούω</span> was ever a complex
sound in Greek, I see nothing to indicate;
hence <i>that</i> λ, and the λ of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λιταὶ, λιαρὸς,</span>
seem to have been different consonants in
Homer, as <i>l</i> and <i>ll</i> in Welsh. As to <i>h</i> and
<i>y</i> I assert nothing, except that critics appear
too hastily to infer, that if a consonant has
disappeared, it must needs be <i>w</i>. It is
credible that the Greek <i>h</i> was once strong
enough to stop hiatus or elision, as the
English, and much more the Asiatic <i>h</i>. The
later Greeks, after turning the character H
into a vowel, seem to have had no idea of
a consonant <i>h</i> in the middle of a word, nor
any means of writing the consonant <i>y</i>.
Since G passes through <i>gh</i> into the sounds
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span><i>h</i>, <i>w</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>f</i> (as in English and German is
obvious), it is easy to confound them all
under the compendious word ‘digamma’.
I should be glad to know that Homer’s
forms were as well understood by modern
scholars as Mr Arnold lays down.</p>

<p class='c005'>On his quotation from Shakspeare, I
remark, 1. ‘Orgulous’, from French <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">‘orgueilleux’</span>,
is intelligible to all who know
French, and is comparable to Sicilian words
in Æschylus. 2. It is contrary to fact to
say, that Homer has not words, and words
in great plenty, as unintelligible to later
Greeks, as ‘orgulous’ to us. 3. <i>Sperr</i>,
for <i>Bar</i>, as <i>Splash</i> for <i>Plash</i>, is much less
than the diversity which separates Homer
from the spoken Attic. What is <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σμικρὸς</span> for
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μικρὸς</span> to compare with <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἠβαιὸς</span> for <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μικρός</span>?
4. Mr Arnold (as I understand him) blames
Shakspeare for being sometimes antiquated:
I do not blame him, nor yet Homer for the
same; but neither can I admit the contrast
which he asserts. He says: ‘Shakspeare
can compose, when he is at his best, in a
language perfectly intelligible, in spite of the
two centuries and a half which part him
from us. <i>Homer has not Shakspeare’s variations</i>:
he is never antiquated, as Shakspeare
is sometimes’. I certainly find the
very same variations in Homer, as Mr
Arnold finds in Shakspeare. My reader
unlearned in Greek might hastily infer from
the facts just laid before him, that Homer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>is always equally strange to a purely Attic
ear: but is not so. The dialects of Greece
did indeed differ strongly, as broad Scotch
from English; yet as we know, Burns is
sometimes perfectly intelligible to an
Englishman, sometimes quite unintelligible.
In spite of Homer’s occasional wide receding
from Attic speech, he as often comes
close to it. For instance, in the first
piece quoted above from Gladstone, the
simile occupying five (Homeric) lines would
<i>almost</i> go down in Sophocles, if the Tragedian
had chosen to use the metre. There
is but one out-and-out Homeric word in it
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐπασσύτερος</span>): and even that is used
once in an Æschylean chorus. There are
no strange inflections, and not a single
digamma is sensibly lost. Its peculiarities
are only -εϊ for ει, ἐὸν for ὂν, and δέ τε for
δέ, which could not embarrass the hearer
as to the sense. I myself reproduce much
the same result. Thus in my translation
of these five lines I have the antiquated
words <i>blore</i> for <i>blast</i>, <i>harry</i> for <i>harass</i> (<i>harrow</i>,
<i>worry</i>), and the antiquated participle <i>hoven</i>
from <i>heave</i>, as <i>cloven</i>, <i>woven</i> from <i>cleave</i>,
<i>weave</i>. The whole has thus just a tinge of
antiquity, as had the Homeric passage to
the Attics, without any need of aid from
a Glossary. But at other times the aid is
occasionally convenient, just as in Homer
or Shakspeare.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mr Arnold plays fallaciously on the words
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>familiar and unfamiliar. Homer’s words
may have been <i>familiar</i> to the Athenians
(<i>i.e.</i> often heard), even when they were <i>not</i>
understood, but, at most, were guessed at;
or when, being understood, they were still
felt and known to be utterly foreign. Of
course, when thus ‘familiar’, they could
not ‘surprise’ the Athenians, as Mr Arnold
complains that my renderings surprise the
English. Let mine be heard as Pope or
even Cowper has been heard, and no one
will be ‘surprised’.</p>

<p class='c005'>Antiquated words are understood well by
some, ill by others, not at all by a third
class; hence it is difficult to decide the
limits of a glossary. Mr Arnold speaks
scornfully of me (he wonders <i>with whom
Mr Newman can have lived</i>), that I use the
words which I use, and explain those which
I explain. He censures my little Glossary,
for containing three words which he did not
know, and some others, which, he says,
are ‘familiar to all the world’. It is clear,
he will never want a stone to throw at me.
I suppose I am often guilty of keeping low
company. I have found ladies whom no
one would guess to be so ill-educated, who
yet do not distinctly know what <i>lusty</i>
means; but have an uncomfortable feeling
that it is very near to <i>lustful</i>; and understand
<i>grisly</i> only in the sense of <i>grizzled</i>, <i>grey</i>.
Great numbers mistake the sense of Buxom,
Imp, Dapper, deplorably. I no more wrote
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>my Glossary than my translation for persons
so highly educated as Mr Arnold.</p>

<p class='c005'>But I must proceed to remark: Homer
might have been as unintelligible to Pericles,
as was the court poet of king Crœsus, and
yet it might be highly improper to translate
him into an old English dialect; namely,
if he had been the typical poet of a logical
and refined age. <i>Here is the real question</i>;—is
he absolutely antique, or only antiquated
relatively, as Euripides is now antiquated?
A modern Greek statesman,
accomplished for every purpose of modern
business, might find himself quite perplexed
by the infinitives, the numerous participles,
the optatives, the datives, by the particle
ἂν, and by the whole syntax of Euripides,
as also by many special words; but this
would never justify us in translating Euripides
into any but a most refined style.
Was Homer of this class? I say, that he
<i>not only was</i> antiquated, relatively to
Pericles, but <i>is also</i> absolutely antique,
being the poet of a barbarian age. Antiquity
in poets is not (as Horace stupidly
imagines in the argument of the horse’s
tail) a question of years, but of intrinsic
qualities. Homer sang to a wholly unfastidious
audience, very susceptible to the
marvellous, very unalive to the ridiculous,
capable of swallowing with reverence the
most grotesque conceptions. Hence nothing
is easier than to turn Homer to ridicule.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>The fun which Lucian made of his mythology,
a rhetorical critic like Mr Arnold
could make of his diction, if he understood
it as he understands mine. He takes credit
to himself for <i>not</i> ridiculing me; and is not
aware, that I could not be like Homer
without being easy to ridicule. An intelligent
child is the second-best reader of
Homer. The best of all is a scholar of
highly masculine taste; the worst of all is
a fastidious and refined man, to whom
everything quaint seems ignoble and contemptible.</p>

<p class='c005'>I might have supposed that Mr Arnold
thinks Homer to be a polished drawing-room
poet, like Pope, when I read in him
this astonishing sentence, <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 35. ‘Search
the English language for a word which does
<i>not</i> apply to Homer, and you could not fix
on a better word than <i>quaint</i>’. But I am
taken aback at finding him praise the diction
of Chapman’s translation in contrast to
mine. Now I never open Chapman, without
being offended at his pushing Homer’s
quaintness most unnecessarily into the
grotesque. Thus in Mr Gladstone’s first
passage above, where Homer says that the
sea ‘sputters out the foam’, Chapman
makes it, ‘<i>all her back in bristles set, spits</i>
every way <i>her</i> foam’, obtruding what may
remind one of a cat or a stoat. I hold
<i>sputter</i> to be epical<a id='r44' /><a href='#f44' class='c009'><sup>[44]</sup></a>, because it is strong;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>but <i>spit</i> is feeble and mean. In passing,
I observe that the universal praise given to
Chapman as ‘Homeric’ (a praise which I
have too absolutely repeated, perhaps
through false shame of depreciating my
only rival) is a testimony to me that I
rightly appreciate Homeric style; for my
style is Chapman’s softened, purged of conceits
and made far more melodious. Mr
Arnold leaves me to wonder, how, with his
disgust at me, he can avoid feeling tenfold
disgust at Chapman; and to wonder also
what he <i>means</i>, by so blankly contradicting
my statement that Homer is quaint; and
why he so vehemently resents it. He does
not vouchsafe to me or to his readers one
particle of disproof or of explanation.</p>

<p class='c005'>I regard it as quaint in Homer to call Juno
<i>white-arm’d goddess</i> and <i>large-ey’d</i>. (I have
not rendered <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">βοῶπις</span> <i>ox-ey’d</i>, because in a
case of doubt I shrank to obtrude anything
so grotesque to us.) It is quaint to say,
‘the lord of bright-haired Juno lightens’
for ‘it lightens’; or ‘my heart in my
<i>shaggy</i> bosom is divided’, for ‘I doubt’:
quaint to call waves <i>wet</i>, milk <i>white</i>, blood
<i>dusky</i>, horses <i>singlehoofed</i>, a hero’s hand
<i>broad</i>, words <i>winged</i>, Vulcan <i>Lobfoot</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Κυλλοποδίων</span>),
a maiden <i>fair-ankled</i>, the Greeks
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span><i>wellgreav’d</i>, a spear <i>longshadowy</i>, battle and
council <i>man-ennobling</i>, one’s knees <i>dear</i>, and
many other epithets. Mr Arnold most
gratuitously asserts that the sense of these
had evaporated to the Athenians. If that
were true, it would not signify to this argument.
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Δαιμόνιος</span> (possessed by an elf or
dæmon) so lost its sense in Attic talk, that
although Æschylus has it in its true meaning,
some college tutors (I am told) render
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὦ δαιμόνιε</span> in Plato, ‘my very good sir!’
This is surely no good reason for mistranslating
the word in Homer. If Mr Arnold
could prove (what he certainly cannot) that
Sophocles had forgotten the derivation of
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐϋκνημῖδες</span> and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐϋμμελίης</span>, and understood
by the former nothing but ‘full armed’ and
by the latter (as he says) nothing but ‘war-like’,
this would not justify his blame of
me for rendering the words correctly. If
the whole Greek nation by long familiarity
had become inobservant of Homer’s ‘oddities’
(conceding this for the moment), that
also would be no fault of mine. That
Homer <i>is</i> extremely peculiar, even if the
Greeks had become deadened to the sense
of it, the proof on all sides is overpowering.</p>

<p class='c005'>It is very quaint to say, ‘the outwork
(or rampart) of the teeth’ instead of ‘the
lips’. If Mr Arnold will call it ‘portentous’
in my English, let him produce some shadow
of reason for denying it to be portentous
in Greek. Many phrases are so quaint as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>to be almost untranslatable, as <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μήστωρ
φόβοιο</span> (deviser of fear?) <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μήστωρ ἀϋτῆς</span>
(deviser of outcry?): others are quaint to
the verge of being comical, as to call a man
an <i>equipoise</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀτάλαντος</span>) to a god, and to
praise eyes for having a <i>curl</i> in them<a id='r45' /><a href='#f45' class='c009'><sup>[45]</sup></a>. It
is quaint to make Juno call Jupiter <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αἰνότατε</span>
(grimmest? direst?), whether she is in
good or bad humour with him, and to call
a Vision <i>ghastly</i>, when it is sent with a
pleasant message. It is astonishingly quaint
to tell how many oxen every fringe of
Athene’s ægis was worth.—It is quaint to
call Patroclus ‘a great simpleton’, for not
foreseeing that he would lose his life in
rushing to the rescue of his countrymen.
(I cannot receive Mr Arnold’s suggested
Biblical correction ‘Thou fool’! which he
thinks grander: first, because grave moral
rebuke is utterly out of place; secondly,
because the Greek cannot mean this;—it
means infantine simplicity, and has precisely
the colour of the word which I have
used.)—It is quaint to say: ‘Patroclus
kindled a great fire, <i>godlike man</i>’! or,
‘Automedon held up the meat, <i>divine</i>
Achilles slic’d it’: quaint to address a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>young friend as ‘Oh<a id='r46' /><a href='#f46' class='c009'><sup>[46]</sup></a> pippin’! or ‘Oh
softheart’! or ‘Oh pet’! whichever is
the true translation. It is quaint to compare
Ajax to an ass whom boys are belabouring,
Ulysses to a pet ram, Agamemnon
in two lines to three gods, and in the third
line to a bull; the Myrmidons to wasps,
Achilles to a grampus chasing little fishes,
Antilochus to a wolf which kills a dog and
runs away. Menelaus striding over Patroclus’s
body to a heifer defending her first-born.
It is quaint to say that Menelaus
was as brave as a bloodsucking fly, that
Agamemnon’s sobs came thick as flashes of
lightning; and that the Trojan mares,
while running, groaned like overflowing
rivers. All such similes come from a mind
quick to discern similarities, but <i>very dull
to feel incongruities</i>; unaware therefore
that it is on a verge where the sublime
easily turns into the ludicrous; a mind and
heart inevitably quaint to the very core.
What is it in Vulcan, when he would comfort
his mother under Jupiter’s threat, to
make jokes about the severe mauling which
he himself formerly received, and his terror
lest she should be now beaten? Still more
quaint (if <i>rollicking</i> is not the word), is the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>address by which Jupiter tries to ingratiate
himself with Juno: viz. he recounts to her
all his unlawful amours, declaring that in
none of them was he so smitten as now. I
have not enough of the γενναῖος εὐηθεία,
the barbarian simple-heartedness, needed by
a reader of Homer, to get through this speech
with gravity. What shall I call it, certainly
much worse than quaint, that the poet adds:
Jupiter was more enamoured than at his
<i>stolen</i> embrace in their first bed ‘secretly
from their dear parents’? But to develop
Homer’s inexhaustible quaintnesses, of
which Mr Arnold denies the existence, seems
to me to need a long treatise. It is not to
be expected, that one who is blind to superficial
facts so very prominent as those which
I have recounted, should retain any delicate
perception of the highly coloured, intense,
and very eccentric diction of Homer, even
if he has ever understood it, which he forces
me to doubt. He sees nothing ‘odd’ in
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κυνὸς κακομηχάνου</span>, or in <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κυνόμυια</span>, ‘thou
dogfly’! He replaces to his imagination
the flesh and blood of the noble barbarian
by a dim feeble spiritless outline.</p>

<p class='c005'>I have not adduced, in proof of Homer’s
quaintness, the monstrous simile given to
us in Iliad 13, 754; viz. Hector ‘darted
forward screaming like a snowy mountain,
and flew through the Trojans and allies’:
for I cannot believe that the poet wrote
anything so absurd. Rather than admit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>this, I have suggested that the text is
corrupt, and that for <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὄρεϊ νιφόεντι</span> we
should read <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὀρνέῳ θύοντι</span>, ‘darted forth
screaming <i>like a raging bird</i>’. Yet, as far
as I know, I am the first man that has here
impugned the text. Mr Brandreth is faithful
in his rendering, except that he says
<i>shouting</i> for <i>screaming</i>:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘He said; and like a snowy mountain, rush’d</div>
      <div class='line'>Shouting; and flew through Trojans and allies.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Chapman, Cowper, and Pope strain and
twist the words to an impossible sense,
putting in something about <i>white plume</i>,
which they fancy suggested a snowy mountain;
but they evidently accept the Greek
as it stands, unhesitatingly. I claim this
phenomenon in proof that to all commentators
and interpreters hitherto Homer’s
quaintness has been such an <i>axiom</i>, that they
have even acquiesced unsuspiciously in an
extravagance which goes far beyond oddity.
Moreover the reader may augur by my
opposite treatment of the passage, with
what discernment Mr Arnold condemns
me of obtruding upon Homer gratuitous
oddities which equal the conceits of Chapman.</p>

<p class='c005'>But, while thus vindicating <i>Quaintness</i>
as an essential quality of Homer, do I regard
it as a weakness to be apologized for? Certainly
not; for it is a condition of his cardinal
excellences. He could not otherwise
be <i>Picturesque</i> as he is. So volatile is his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>mind, that what would be a Metaphor in a
more logical and cultivated age, with him
riots in Simile which overflows its banks.
His similes not merely go beyond<a id='r47' /><a href='#f47' class='c009'><sup>[47]</sup></a> the
mark of likeness; in extreme cases they
even turn into contrariety. If he were not
so carried away by his illustration, as to
forget what he is illustrating (which belongs
to a quaint mind), he would never paint
for us such full and splendid pictures.
Where a logical later poet would have said
that Menelaus</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>With <i>eagle-eye</i> survey’d the field,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>the mere metaphor contenting him; Homer
says:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Gazing around on every side, &#8196;&#8196;&#8196; in fashion of an eagle,</div>
      <div class='line'>Which, of all heaven’s fowl, they say, &#8196;&#8196;&#8196; to scan the earth is keenest:</div>
      <div class='line'>Whose eye, when loftiest he hangs, &#8196;&#8196;&#8196; not the swift hare escapeth,</div>
      <div class='line'>Lurking amid a leaf-clad bush: &#8196;&#8196;&#8196; but straight at it he souseth,</div>
      <div class='line'>Unerring; and with crooked gripe &#8196;&#8196;&#8196; doth quickly rieve its spirit.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>I feel this long simile to be a disturbance
of the logical balance, such as belongs to
the lively eye of the savage, whose observation
is intense, his concentration of reasoning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>powers feeble. Without this, we should
never have got anything so picturesque.</p>

<p class='c005'>Homer never sees things <i>in the same proportions</i>
as we see them. To omit his
digressions, and what I may call his ‘impertinences’,
in order to give to his argument
that which Mr Arnold is pleased to call the
proper ‘balance’, is to value our own logical
minds, more than his picturesque<a id='r48' /><a href='#f48' class='c009'><sup>[48]</sup></a> but
illogical mind.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mr Arnold says that I am not quaint, but
grotesque, in my rendering of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κυνὸς
κακομηχάνου</span>. I do not hold the phrase
to be quaint: to me it is excessively coarse.
When Jupiter calls Juno ‘a bitch’, of course
he means a snarling cur; hence my rendering,
‘vixen’ (or she-fox), is there perfect,
since we say <i>vixen</i> of an irascible woman.
But Helen had no such evil tempers, and
beyond a doubt she meant to ascribe impurity
to herself. I have twice committed
a pious fraud by making her call herself ‘a
vixen’, where ‘bitch’ is the only faithful
rendering; and Mr Arnold, instead of
thanking me for throwing a thin veil over
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>Homer’s deformity, assails me for my phrase
as intolerably grotesque.</p>

<p class='c005'>He further forbids me to invent new
compound adjectives, as fair-thron’d, rill-bestream’d;
because they strike us as new,
though Homer’s epithets (he says) did not
so strike the Greeks: hence they derange
attention from the main question. I hold
this doctrine of his (conceding his fact for
a moment) to be destructive of all translation
whatever, into prose or poetry. When
Homer tells us that Achilles’ horses were
munching lotus and parsley, Pope renders
it by ‘the horses grazed’, and does not say
on what. Using Mr Arnold’s principles,
he might defend himself by arguing: ‘The
Greeks, being familiar with such horsefood,
were not struck by it as new, as my reader
would be. I was afraid of telling him <i>what</i>
the horses were eating, lest it should derange
the balance of his mind, and injuriously
divert him from the main idea of the
sentence’. But, I find, readers are indignant
on learning Pope’s suppression:
they feel that he has defrauded them of a
piece of interesting information.—In short,
how <i>can</i> an Englishman read any Greek
composition and be affected by it as Greeks
were? In a piece of Euripides my imagination
is caught by many things, which he
never intended or calculated for the prominence
which they actually get in my
mind. This or that absurdity in mythology,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>which passed with him as matter of
course, may monopolize my main attention.
Our minds are not passive recipients of this
or that poet’s influence; but the poet is
the material on which our minds actively
work. If an unlearned reader thinks it
very ‘odd’ of Homer (the first time he hears
it) to call Aurora ‘fair-thron’d’, so does a
boy learning Greek think it odd to call her
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">εὔθρονος</span>. Mr Arnold ought to blot every
odd Homeric epithet out of his <i>Greek</i> Homer
(or never lend the copy to a youthful
learner) if he desires me to expunge ‘fair-thron’d’
from the translation. Nay, I
think he should conceal that the Morning
was esteemed as a goddess, though she had
no altars or sacrifice. It is <i>all</i> odd. But
that is just why people want to read an
English Homer,—to know all his oddities,
exactly as learned men do. He is the
phenomenon to be studied. His peculiarities,
pleasant or unpleasant, are to be made
known, precisely because of his great eminence
and his substantial deeply seated
worth. Mr Arnold writes like a timid
biographer, fearful to let too much of his
friend come out. So much as to the substance.
As to mere words, here also I hold
the very reverse of Mr Arnold’s doctrine.
I do not feel free to translate οὐρανομήκης
by ‘heaven-kissing’, precisely <i>because</i>
Shakspeare has used the last word. It
is his property, as <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐϋκνημῖδες, ἐϋμμελίης,</span>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span><span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κυδιάνειρα</span>, etc., are Homer’s property. I
could not use it without being felt to <i>quote</i>
Shakspeare, which would be highly inappropriate
in a Homeric translation. But
<i>if</i> nobody had ever yet used the phrase
‘heaven-kissing’ (or if it were current
without any proprietor) <i>then</i> I should be
quite free to use it as a rendering of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">οὐρανομήκης</span>.
I cannot assent to a critic killing
the vital powers of our tongue. If Shakspeare
might invent the compound ‘heaven-kissing’,
or ‘man-ennobling’, so might
William Wordsworth or Matthew Arnold;
and so might I. Inspiration is not dead,
nor yet is the English language.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mr Arnold is slow to understand what
I think very obvious. Let me then put a
case. What if I were to scold a missionary
for rendering in Feejee the phrase ‘kingdom
of heaven’ and ‘Lamb of God’ accurately;
also ‘saints’ and other words <i>characteristic
of the New Testament</i>? I might urge against
him: ‘This and that sounds very <i>odd</i> to
the Feejees: that cannot be right, for it
did <i>not</i> seem odd to the Nicene bishops.
The latter had forgotten that <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">βασιλεία</span> meant
“kingdom”; they took the phrase “kingdom
of God” collectively to mean “the
Church”. The phrase did not surprise
them. As to “Lambs”, the Feejees are not
accustomed to sacrifice, and cannot be expected
to know of themselves what “Lamb
of God” means, as Hebrews did. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>courtiers of Constantine thought it very
natural to be called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἅγιοι</span>, for they were
accustomed to think every baptised person
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἅγιος</span>; but to the baptised courtiers of
Feejee it really seems very <i>odd</i> to be called
<i>saints</i>. You disturb the balance of their
judgment’.</p>

<p class='c005'>The missionary might reply: ‘You seemed
to be ashamed of the oddities of the Gospel.
I am not. They grow out of its excellences
and cannot be separated. By avoiding a
few eccentric phrases you will do little to
remove the deep-seated eccentricity of its
very essence. Odd and eccentric it will
remain, unless you despoil it of its heart,
and reduce it to a fashionable philosophy’.
And just so do I reply to Mr Arnold. The
Homeric style (whether it be that of an
individual or of an age) is peculiar, is ‘odd’,
if Mr Arnold like the word, to the very core.
Its eccentricities in epithet are mere efflorescences
of its essential eccentricity. If
Homer could cry out to us, I doubt not he
would say, as Oliver Cromwell to the
painter, ‘Paint me just I am, <i>wart and all</i>’:
but if the true Homer could reappear, I am
sure Mr Arnold would start from him just
as a bishop of Rome from a fisherman
apostle. If a translator of the Bible honours
the book by his close rendering of its characteristics,
however ‘odd’, so do I honour
Homer by the same. Those characteristics,
the moment I produce them, Mr
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>Arnold calls <i>ignoble</i>. Well: be it so; but
I am not to blame for them. They exist
whether Mr Arnold likes them or not.</p>

<p class='c005'>I will here observe that he bids me
paraphrase <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τανύπεπλος</span> (trailing-robed) into
something like, ‘Let gorgeous Tragedy
With sceptred pall come sweeping by’. I
deliberately judge, that to paraphrase an
otiose epithet is the very worst thing that
can be done: to omit it entirely would be
better. I object even to Mr Gladstone’s</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in6'>... whom Leto bare,</div>
      <div class='line'>Leto with the flowing hair.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>For the repetition overdoes the prominence
of the epithet. Still more extravagant is
Mr Arnold in wishing me to turn ‘single-hoofed
horses’ in to ‘something which <i>as
little surprises us</i> as “Gallop apace, you
fiery-footed steeds”’: <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 96. To reproduce
Shakspeare would be in any case a ‘surprising’
mode of translating Homer: but
the principle which changes ‘single-hoofed’
into a different epithet which the translator
thinks <i>better</i>, is precisely that which for
more than two centuries has made nearly
all English translation worthless. To throw
the poet into your crucible, and bring out
old Pelias young, is not a hopeful process.
I had thought, the manly taste of this day
had outgrown the idea that a translator’s
business is to melt up the old coin and
stamp it with a modern image. I am
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>wondering that I should have to write
against such notions: I would not take the
trouble, only that they come against me
from an Oxford Professor of Poetry.</p>

<p class='c005'>At the same time, his doctrine, as I have
said, goes far beyond compound epithets.
Whether I say ‘motley-helmèd Hector’ or
‘Hector of the motley helm’, ‘silver-footed
Thetis’ or ‘Thetis of the silver foot’, ‘man-ennobling
combat’ or ‘combat which ennobles
man’, the novelty is so nearly on a
par, that he cannot condemn one and justify
the other on this score. Even Pope falls
far short of the false taste which would
plane down every Homeric prominence: for
he prizes an elegant epithet like ‘silver-footed’,
however new and odd.</p>

<p class='c005'>From such a Homer as Mr Arnold’s
specimens and principles would give us,
no one could <i>learn</i> anything; no one could
have any motive for reading the translation.
He smooths down the stamp of Homer’s
coin, till nothing is left even for microscopic
examination. When he forbids me (<abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> <a href='#Page_96'>96</a>)
to let my reader know that Homer calls
horses ‘single-hoofed’, of course he would
suppress also the epithets ‘white milk’,
‘dusky blood’, ‘dear knees’, ‘dear life’,
etc. His process obliterates everything
characteristic, great or small.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mr Arnold condemns my translating certain
names of horses. He says (<abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> <a href='#Page_5'>5</a>8):
‘Mr Newman calls Xanthus <i>Chesnut</i>; as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>he calls Balius <i>Spotted</i> and Podarga <i>Spry-foot</i>:
which is as if a Frenchman were to
call Miss Nightingale <i>Mdelle. Rossignol</i>, or
Mr Bright <i>M. Clair</i>’. He is very wanting
in discrimination. If I had translated
Hector into <i>Possessor</i> or Agamemnon into
<i>Highmind</i>, his censure would be just. A
Miss White may be a brunette, a Miss Brown
may be a blonde: we utter the proper names
of men and women without any remembrance
of their intrinsic meaning. But it is different
with many names of domestic animals. We
never call a dog <i>Spot</i>, unless he is spotted;
nor without consciousness that the name
expresses his peculiarity. No one would
give to a black horse the name Chesnut;
nor, if he had called a chesnut horse by
the name Chesnut, would he ever forget
the meaning of the name while he used it.
The Greeks called a chesnut horse <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><i>xanthos</i></span>
and a spotted horse <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><i>balios</i></span>; therefore, until
Mr Arnold proves the contrary, I believe
that they never read the names of Achilles’
two horses without a sense of their meaning.
Hence the names ought to be translated;
while Hector and Laomedon ought not. The
same reasoning applies to Podarga, though
I do not certainly understand <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀργός</span>. I have
taken it to mean <i>sprightly</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mr Arnold further asserts, that Homer is
never ‘garrulous’. Allowing that too many
others agree with me, he attributes our error
to giving too much weight to a sentence in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>Horace! I admire Horace as an ode-writer,
but I do not revere him as a critic,
any more than as a moral philosopher. I
say that Homer is garrulous, because I see
and feel it. Mr Arnold puts me into a most
unwelcome position. I have a right to say,
I have some enthusiasm for Homer. In
the midst of numerous urgent calls of duty
and taste, I devoted every possible quarter
of an hour for two years and a half to translate
the Iliad, toiling unremittingly in my
vacations and in my walks, and going to
large expenses of money, in order to put the
book before the unlearned; and this, though
I am not a Professor of Poetry nor even of
Greek. Yet now I am forced to appear as
Homer’s disparager and accuser! But if
Homer were always a poet, he could not be,
what he is, so many other things beside
poet. As the Egyptians paint in their
tombs processes of art, not because they
are beautiful or grand, but from a mere
love of imitating; so Homer narrates perpetually
from a mere love of chatting. In
how thoroughly Egyptian a way does he tell
the process of cutting up an ox and making
<i>kebâb</i>; the process of bringing a boat to
anchor and carefully putting by the tackle;
the process of taking out a shawl from a
chest, where it lies at the very bottom!
With what glee he repeats the secret talk
of the gods; and can tell all about the
toilet of Juno. Every particular of trifling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>actions comes out with him, as, the opening
of a door or box with a key. He tells who
made Juno’s earrings or veil or the shield
of Ajax, the history of Agamemnon’s breast-plate,
and in what detail a hero puts on his
pieces of armour. I would not press the
chattiness of Pandarus, Glaucus, Nestor,
Æneas, in the midst of battle; I might
press his description of wounds. Indeed I
have said enough, and more than enough,
against Mr Arnold’s novel, unsupported,
paradoxical assertion.—But this is connected
with another subject. I called
Homer’s manner ‘direct’: Mr Arnold (if
I understand) would supersede this by his
own epithet ‘rapid’. But I cannot admit
the exchange: Homer is often the opposite
of rapid. Amplification is his characteristic,
as it must be of every improvisatore,
every popular orator: condensation indeed
is improper for anything but written style;
written to be read privately. But I regard
as Homer’s worst defect, his lingering over
scenes of endless carnage and painful
wounds. He knows to half an inch where
one hero hits another and how deep. They
arm: they approach: they encounter: we
have to listen to stereotype details again
and again. Such a style is anything but
‘rapid’. Homer’s garrulity often leads
him into it; yet he can do far better, as
in a part of the fight over Patroclus’s body,
and other splendid passages.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>Garrulity often vents itself in expletives.
Mr Arnold selects for animadversion this
line of mine (<abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 41),</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘A thousand fires along the plain, <i>I say</i>, that night were gleaming’.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>He says: ‘This may be the genuine style
of ballad poetry, but it is <i>not</i> the style of
Homer’. I reply; my use of expletives
is moderate indeed compared to Homer’s.
Mr Arnold writes, as if quite unaware that
such words as the intensely prosaic ἄρα, and
its abbreviations ἂρ, ῥα, with τοι, τε, δὴ,
μάλα, ἦ, ἦ ῥα νυ, περ, overflow in epic style;
and that a pupil who has mastered the very
copious stock of Attic particles, is taken
quite aback by the extravagant number in
Homer. Our expletives are generally more
offensive, because longer. My principle is,
to admit only such expletives as <i>add energy</i>,
and savour of antiquity. To the feeble
expletives of mean ditties I am not prone.

<p class='c008'>The ‘humbly conceiving’ certainly outdoes

<p class='c005'>Since Mr Arnold momentarily appeals to
me on the chasm between Attic and Homeric
Greek, I turn the last piece into a style <i>far
less</i> widely separated from modern English
than Homer from Thucydides.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>I certainly do <i>not</i> recommend this style to
a translator, yet it would have its advantage.
Even with a smaller change of dialect it
would aid us over Helen’s self-piercing denunciation,
‘approaching to Christian penitence’,
as some have judged it.</p>

<p class='c008'>But in behalf of the poet I must avow:
when one considers how dramatic he is, it
is marvellous how little in him can offend.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>For this very reason he is above needing
tender treatment from a translator, but can
bear faithful rendering, not only better
than Shakspeare but better than Pindar
or Sophocles.</p>

<p class='c005'>When Mr Arnold denies that Homer is
ever prosaic or homely, his own specimens
of translation put me into despair of convincing
him; for they seem to me a very
anthology of prosaic flatness. Phrases,
which are not in themselves bad, if they
were elevated by something in the syntax
or rhythm distinguishing them from prose,
become in him prose out-and-out. ‘To
Peleus why did we give you, to a mortal’?
‘In the plain <i>there</i> were kindled a thousand
fires; by each one <i>there</i> sate fifty men’.
[At least he might have left out the expletive.]
‘By their chariots stood the
steeds, and champed the white barley;
while their masters sate by the fire and
waited for morning’. ‘Us, whose portion
for ever Zeus has made it, from youth <i>right
up</i> to age, to be winding skeins of grievous
wars, till <i>every soul of us</i> perish’. The words
which I here italicize, seem to me below
noble ballad. What shall I say of ‘I bethink
me what the Trojan men and Trojan
women might murmur’. ‘Sacred Troy
shall <i>go to destruction</i>’. ‘Or bear pails to
the well of Messeϊs’. ‘See, the wife of
Hector, that great pre-eminent captain of
the horsemen of Troy, <i>in the day they fought</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>for their city’, for, ‘<i>who was</i> captain in the
day <i>on which</i>——’. ‘Let me be dead and the
earth be mounded (?) above me, ere I hear
thy cries, and thy captivity<a id='r49' /><a href='#f49' class='c009'><sup>[49]</sup></a> <i>told of</i>’. ‘By
no slow pace or want of swiftness <i>of ours</i><a id='r50' /><a href='#f50' class='c009'><sup>[50]</sup></a>
did the Trojans <i>obtain to strip</i> the arms of
Patroclus’. ‘Here I am destined to perish,
far from my father and mother dear; <i>for
all that</i>, I will not’, etc. ‘Dare they not
enter the fight, or stand in the council of
heroes, <i>all</i> for fear of the shame and the
<i>taunts my crime</i> has awakened?’ One who
regards all this to be high poetry,—emphatically
‘noble’,—may well think <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τὸν δ’ ἀπαμειβόμενος</span>
or ‘with him there came forty
black galleys’, or the broiling of the beef
collops, to be such. When Mr Arnold regards
‘no want of swiftness of <i>ours</i>’; ‘for
all that’, in the sense of nevertheless; ‘<i>all</i>
for fear’, <i>i.e.</i> because of the fear; <i>not</i> to be
prosaic: my readers, however ignorant of
Greek, will dispense with further argument
from me. Mr Arnold’s inability to discern
prose in Greek is not to be trusted.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>But I see something more in this phenomenon.
Mr Arnold is an original poet;
and, as such, certainly uses a diction far
more elevated than he here puts forward to
represent Homer. He calls his Homeric
diction <i>plain</i> and <i>simple</i>. Interpreting these
words from the contrast of Mr Arnold’s own
poems, I claim his suffrage as on my side, that
Homer is often in a style much lower than
what the moderns esteem to be poetical.
But I protest, that he carries it <i>very much</i>
too far, and levels the noblest down to the
most negligent style of Homer. The poet
is <i>not</i> always so ‘ignoble’, as the unlearned
might infer from my critic’s specimens. He
never drops so low as Shakspeare; yet if he
were as sustained as Virgil or Milton, he
would with it lose his vast superiority over
these, his rich variety. That the whole first
book of the Iliad is pitched lower than the
rest, though it has vigorous descriptions,
is denoted by the total absence of simile in
it: for Homer’s kindling is always indicated
by simile. The second book rises on
the first, until the catalogue of ships, which
(as if to atone for its flatness) is ushered in
by five consecutive similes. In the third
and fourth books the poet continues to rise,
and almost culminates in the fifth; but then
seems to restrain himself, lest nothing grander
be left for Achilles. Although I do not believe
in a unity of authorship between the
Odyssey and the Iliad, yet in the Iliad itself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>I see such unity, that I cannot doubt its
negligences to be from art. (The monstrous
speech of Nestor in the 11th book is a case
by itself. About 100 lines have perhaps
been added later, for reasons other than
literary.) I observe that just before the
poet is about to bring out Achilles in his
utmost splendour, he has three-quarters of a
book comparatively tame, with a ridiculous
legend told by Agamemnon in order to cast
his own sins upon Fate. If Shakspeare introduces
coarse wrangling, buffoonery, or
mean superstition, no one claims or wishes
this to be in a high diction or tragic rhythm;
and why should anyone wish such a thing
from Homer or Homer’s translator? I find
nothing here in the poet to apologize for;
but much cause for indignation, when the
unlearned public is misled by translators
or by critics to expect delicacy and elegance
out of place. But I beg the unlearned to
judge for himself whether Homer <i>can</i> have
intended such lines as the following for
poetry, and whether I am bound to make
them any better than I do.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Then visiting he urged each man with words,</div>
      <div class='line'>Mesthles and Glaucus and Medon and Thersilochus</div>
      <div class='line'>And Asteropæus and Deisenor and Hippothoüs</div>
      <div class='line'>And Phorkys and Chromius and Ennomus the augur.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>He has lines in plenty as little elevated.
If they came often in masses, it would be
best to translate them into avowed prose:
but since gleams of poetry break out amid
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>what is flattest, I have no choice but to
imitate Homer in retaining a uniform, but
easy and unpretending metre. Mr Arnold
calls my metre ‘slip-shod’: if it can rise
into grandeur when needful, the epithet is
a praise.</p>

<p class='c005'>Of course I hold the Iliad to be <i>generally</i>
noble and grand. Very many of the poet’s
conceptions were grand to him, mean to us:
especially is he mean and absurd in scenes
of conflict between the gods. Besides, he
is disgusting and horrible occasionally in
word and thought; as when Hecuba wishes
to ‘cling on Achilles and eat up his liver’;
when (as Jupiter says) Juno would gladly
eat Priam’s children raw; when Jupiter
hanged Juno up and fastened a pair of
anvils to her feet; also in the description
of dreadful wounds, and the treatment
which (Priam says) dogs give to an old
man’s corpse. The descriptions of Vulcan
and Thersites are ignoble; so is the mode
of mourning for Hector adopted by Priam;
so is the treatment of the populace by
Ulysses, which does but reflect the manners
of the day. I am not now blaming Homer
for these things; but I say no treatment
can elevate the subject; the translator
must not be expected to make noble what
is not so intrinsically.</p>

<p class='c005'>If anyone think that I am disparaging
Homer, let me remind him of the horrid
grossnesses of Shakspeare, which yet are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>not allowed to lessen our admiration of
Shakspeare’s grandeur. The Homer of the
Iliad is morally pure and often very tender;
but to expect refinement and universal delicacy
of expression in that stage of civilization
is quite anachronistic and unreasonable.
As in earlier England, so in Homeric Greece,
even high poetry partook of the coarseness
of society. This was probably inevitable,
precisely because Greek epic poetry was so
<i>natural</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mr Arnold says that I make Homer’s
nobleness <i>eminently ignoble</i>. This suggests
to me to quote a passage, not because I
think myself particularly successful in it,
but because the poet is evidently aiming
to be grand, when his mightiest hero puts
forth mighty boastings, offensive to some
of the gods. It is the speech of Achilles
over the dead body of Asteropæus (Iliad
21, 184). Whether I make it ignoble, by
my diction or my metre, the reader must
judge.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr Arnold has in some respects attacked
me discreetly; I mean, where he has said
that which damages me with his readers,
and yet leaves me no possible reply. What
is easier than for one to call another ignoble?
what more damaging? what harder to refute?
Then when he speaks of my ‘metrical
exploits’ how can I be offended? to
what have I to reply? His words are expressive
either of compliment or of contempt;
but in either case are untangible.
Again: when he would show how tender he
has been of my honour, and how unwilling
to expose my enormities, he says: <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 57:
‘I will by no means search in Mr Newman’s
version for passages likely to raise a laugh:
that search, <i>alas!</i> would be far too easy’;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>I find the pity which the word <i>alas!</i> expresses,
to be very clever, and very effective
against me. But, I think, he was not discreet,
but very unwise, in making dogmatic
statements on the ground of erudition, many
of which I have exposed; and about which
much more remains to be said than space
will allow me.</p>

<p class='c005'>In his denial that Homer is ‘garrulous’,
he complains that so many think him to be
‘diffuse’. Mr Arnold, it seems, is unaware
of that very prominent peculiarity; which
suits ill even to Mr Gladstone’s style. Thus,
where Homer said (and I said) in a passage
quoted above, ‘people that have <i>a voice in
their bosom</i>’, Mr Gladstone has only ‘<i>speaking</i>
men’. I have noticed the epithet
<i>shaggy</i> as quaint, in ‘His heart in his shaggy
bosom was divided’, where, in a moral
thought, a physical epithet is obtruded.
But even if ‘shaggy’ be dropped, it remains
diffuse (and characteristically so) to
say ‘my <i>heart in my bosom</i> is divided’, for
‘I doubt’. So—‘I will speak what <i>my
heart in my bosom</i> bids me’. So, Homer
makes men think <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κατὰ φρένα καὶ κατὰ
θυμὸν</span>, ‘in their heart <i>and mind</i>’; and
deprives them of ‘mind and soul’. Also:
‘this appeared to him <i>in his mind</i> to be
the best counsel’. Mr Arnold assumes
tones of great superiority; but every school-boy
knows that diffuseness is a distinguishing
characteristic of Homer. Again, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>poet’s epithets are often selected by their
convenience for his metre; sometimes perhaps
even appropriated for no other cause.
No one has ever given any better reason
why Diomedes and Menelaus are almost
exclusively called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">βοὴν ἀγαθὸς</span>, except that
it suits the metre. This belongs to the improvisatore,
the negligent, the ballad style.
The word <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐϋμμελίης</span>, which I with others
render ‘ashen-speared’, is said of Priam,
of Panthus, and of sons of Panthus. Mr
Arnold rebukes me, <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 106, for violating
my own principles. ‘I say, on the other
hand, that <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">εὐμμελίω</span> has <i>not</i> the effect<a id='r51' /><a href='#f51' class='c009'><sup>[51]</sup></a>
of a peculiarity in the original, while “ashen-speared”
<i>has</i> the effect of a peculiarity in
the English: and “warlike” is as marking
an equivalent as I dare give for <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐϋμμελίω</span>,
<i>for fear of disturbing the balance of expression</i>
in Homer’s sentence’. Mr Arnold cannot
write a sentence on Greek, without showing
an ignorance hard to excuse in one who
thus comes forward as a vituperating censor.
<i>Warlike</i> is a word current in the lips and
books of all Englishmen: <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐϋμμελίης</span> is a
word <i>never</i> used, never, I believe, in all
Greek literature, by anyone but Homer.
If he does but turn to Liddell and Scott,
he will see their statement, that the Attic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>form <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">εὐμελίας</span> is only to be found in
grammars. He is here, as always, wrong
in his facts. The word is most singular
in Greek; more singular by far than ‘ashen-spear’d’
in English, because it is more
obscure, as is its special application to one
or two persons: and in truth I have doubted
whether we any better understand Eumelian
Priam than Gerenian Nestor.—Mr Arnold
presently imputes to me the opinion that
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χιτὼν</span> means ‘a cloak’, <i>which he does not
dispute</i>; but if I had thought it necessary
to be literal, I must have rendered <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χαλκοχίτωνες</span>
brazen-shirted. He suggests to me
the rendering ‘brazen-coated’, which I have
used in <abbr title='iliad'>Il.</abbr> 4, 285 and elsewhere. I have
also used ‘brazen-clad’, and I now prefer
‘brazen-mail’d’. I here wish only to press
that Mr Arnold’s criticism proceeds on a
false fact. Homer’s epithet was <i>not</i> a
familiar word at Athens (in any other sense
than as Burns or Virgil may be familiar to
Mr Arnold), but was strange, unknown even
to their poets; hence his demand that I
shall use a word already familiar in English
poetry is doubly baseless. The later poets
of Greece have plenty of words beginning
with <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χαλκο-</span>; but this one word is exclusively
Homer’s.—Everything that I have
now said, may be repeated still more pointedly
concerning <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐϋκνημῖδες</span>, inasmuch as directing
attention to leg-armour is peculiarly
quaint. No one in all Greek literature (as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>far as I know) names the word but Homer;
and yet Mr Arnold turns on me with his ever
reiterated, ever unsupported, assertions and
censures, of course assuming that ‘the
scholar’ is with him. (I have no theory
at hand, to explain why he regards his own
word to suffice without attempt at proof.)
The epithet is intensely peculiar; and I
observe that Mr Arnold has not dared to
suggest a translation. It is clear to me that
he is ashamed of my poet’s oddities; and
has no mode of escaping from them but by
bluntly denying facts. Equally peculiar to
Homer are the words <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κυδιάνειρα, τανύπεπλος</span>
and twenty others, equally unknown to Attic
the peculiar compound <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μελιήδης</span> (adopted
from Homer by Pindar), about all which
he carps at me on false grounds. But I
pass these, and speak a little more at length
about <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μέροπες</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'>Will the reader allow me to vary these

<p class='c005'>Mr Arnold will see in the Scholiast on
Iliad 1, 250, precisely this order of analysis
for <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μέροπες</span>. It seems to me to give not
a traditional but a grammatical explanation.
Be that as it may, it indicates that a Greek
had to pass through <i>exactly the same process</i>
in order to expound <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μέροπες</span>, as an
Englishman to get sense out of ‘voice-dividing’.
The word is twice used by
Æschylus, who affects Homeric words, and
once by Euripides (Iph. T.) in the connection
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πολέσιν μερόπων</span>, where the very unusual
Ionism <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πολέσιν</span> shows in how Homeric a
region is the poet’s fancy. No other word
ending in οψ except <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μέροψ</span> can be confidently
assigned to the root ὂψ, a voice. <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"> Ἦνοψ</span> in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>Homer (itself of most uncertain sense and
derivation) is generally referred to the other
ὄψ. The sense of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἔλλοψ</span> again<a id='r52' /><a href='#f52' class='c009'><sup>[52]</sup></a> is very
uncertain. Every way therefore <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μέροψ</span> is
‘odd’ and obscure. The phrase ‘articulating’
is utterly prosaic and inadmissible.
<i>Vocal</i> is rather too Latinized for my style,
and besides, is apt to mean <i>melodious</i>. The
phrase ‘voice-dividing’ is indeed easier
to us than μέροπες can have been to the
Athenians, because we all know what <i>voice</i>
means, but they had to be taught scholastically
what <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὄπα</span> meant; nor would easily
guess that ὂψ in <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μέροψ</span> had a sense, differing
from ὂψ in <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">(ἀ)στέροψ οἶνοψ, αἶθοψ, αἶθίοψ,
νῶροψ (ἦνοψ), χάροψ</span>. Finally, since <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μέροπες</span>
is only found in the plural, it remains an
open question, whether it does not mean
‘speaking various languages’. Mr Arnold
will find that Stephanus and Scapula treat
it as doubtful, though Liddell and Scott do
not name the second interpretation. I
desired to leave in the English all the uncertainty
of the Greek: but my critic is
unencumbered with such cares.</p>

<p class='c005'>Hitherto I have been unwillingly thrown
into nothing but antagonism to Mr Arnold,
who thereby at least adds tenfold value to
his praise, and makes me proud when he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>declares that the <i>structure</i> of my sentences
is good and Homeric. For this I give the
credit to my metre, which alone confers
on me this cardinal advantage. But in
turn I will compliment Mr Arnold at the
expense of some other critics. He does
know, and they do not, the difference of
<i>flowing</i> and <i>smooth</i>. A mountain torrent
is flowing, but often very rough; such is
Homer. The ‘staircases of Neptune’ on
the canal of Languedoc are smooth, but do
not flow: you have to descend abruptly
from each level to the next. It would be
unjust to say absolutely, that such is Pope’s
smoothness; yet often, I feel, this censure
would not be too severe. The rhyme forces
him to so frequent a change of the nominative,
that he becomes painfully discontinuous,
where Homer is what Aristotle
calls ‘long-linked’. At the same time, in
our language, in order to impart a flowing
style, good structure does not suffice. A
principle is needed, unknown to the Greeks;
viz. the natural divisions of the sentence
oratorically, must coincide with the divisions
of the verse musically. To attain this
<i>always</i> in a long poem, is very difficult to
a translator who is scrupulous as to tampering
with the sense. I have not always been
successful in this. But before any critic
passes on me the general sentence that I
am ‘deficient in flow’, let him count up
the proportion of instances in which he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>can justly make the complaint, and mark
whether they occur in elevated passages.</p>

<p class='c005'>I shall now speak of the peculiarities of my
diction, under three heads: 1. old or antiquated
words; 2. coarse words expressive
of outward actions, but having no moral
colour; 3. words of which the sense has
degenerated in modern days.</p>

<p class='c005'>1. Mr Arnold appears to regard what is
<i>antiquated</i> as <i>ignoble</i>. I think him, as usual,
in fundamental error. In general the nobler
words come from ancient style, and in no
case can it be said that old words (as such)
are ignoble. To introduce such terms as
<i>whereat</i>, <i>therefrom</i>, <i>quoth</i>, <i>beholden</i>, <i>steed</i>, <i>erst</i>,
<i>anon</i>, <i>anent</i>, into the midst of style which in
all other respects is modern and prosaic, would
be like to that which we often hear from
half-educated people. The want of harmony
makes us regard it as low-minded and uncouth.
From this cause (as I suspect) has
stolen into Mr Arnold’s mind the fallacy,
that the words themselves are uncouth<a id='r53' /><a href='#f53' class='c009'><sup>[53]</sup></a>.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>But the words are excellent, if only they are
in proper keeping with the general style.—Now
it is very possible, that in some passages,
few or many, I am open to the charge
of having mixed old and new style unskilfully;
but I cannot admit that the old
words (as such) are ignoble. No one speaks
of Spenser’s dialect, nay, nor of Thomson’s;
although with Thomson it was assumed,
exactly as by me, but to a far greater extent,
and without any such necessity as
urges me. As I have stated in my preface,
a broad tinge of antiquity in the style is
essential, to make Homer’s barbaric puerilities
and eccentricities less offensive. (Even
Mr Arnold would admit this, if he admitted
my <i>facts</i>: but he denies that there is anything
eccentric, antique, quaint, barbaric
in Homer: that is his <i>only</i> way of resisting
my conclusion.) If Mr Gladstone were able
to give his valuable time to work out an
entire Iliad in his refined modern style, I
feel confident that he would find it impossible
to deal faithfully with the eccentric phraseology
and with the negligent parts of the
poem. I have the testimony of an unfriendly
reviewer, that I am the first and
<i>only</i> translator that has dared to give
Homer’s constant epithets and not conceal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>his forms of thought: of course I could not
have done this in modern style. The lisping
of a child is well enough from a child, but
is disgusting in a full-grown man. Cowper
and Pope systematically cut out from
Homer whatever they cannot make <i>stately</i>,
and harmonize with modern style: even
Mr Brandreth often shrinks, though he is
brave enough to say <i>ox-eyed Juno</i>. Who
then can doubt the extreme unfitness of
their metre and of their modern diction?
My opposers never fairly meet the argument.
Mr Arnold, when most gratuitously censuring
my mild rendering of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κυνὸς κακομηχάνου
ὀκρυοέσσης</span>, <i>does not dare to suggest any
English for it himself</i>. Even Mr Brandreth
skips it. It is not merely offensive words;
but the purest and simplest phrases, as a
man’s ‘dear life’, ‘dear knees’, or his
‘tightly-built house’, are a stumbling-block
to translators. No stronger proof is
necessary, or perhaps is possible, than these
phenomena give, that to shed an antique
hue over Homer is of first necessity to a
translator: without it, <i>injustice</i> is done both
to the reader and to the poet. Whether I
have managed the style well, is a separate
question, and is matter of detail. I may
have sometimes done well, sometimes ill;
but I claim that my critics shall judge me
from a broader ground, and shall not pertinaciously
go on comparing my version
with modern style, and condemning me as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>(what they are pleased to call) <i>inelegant</i>
because it is not like refined modern poetry,
when it specially avoids to be such. They
never deal thus with Thomson or Chatterton,
any more than with Shakspeare or Spenser.</p>

<p class='c005'>There is no sharp distinction possible between
the foreign and the antiquated in
language. What is obsolete with us, may
still live somewhere: as, what in Greek is
called Poetic or Homeric, may at the same
time be living Æolic. So, whether I take
a word from Spenser or from Scotland, is
generally unimportant. I do not remember
more than four Scotch words, which I have
occasionally adopted for convenience; viz.
Callant, young man; Canny, right-minded;
Bonny, handsome; to Skirl, to cry shrilly.
A trochaic word, which I cannot get in
English, is sometimes urgently needed. It
is astonishing to me that those who ought
to know both what a large mass of antique
and foreign-sounding words an Athenian
found in Homer, and how many Doric or
Sicilian forms as well as Homeric words the
Greek tragedians <i>on principle</i> brought into
their songs, should make the outcry that
they do against my very limited use of that
which has an antique or Scotch sound.
Classical scholars ought to set their faces
against the double heresy, of trying to enforce,
that foreign poetry, however various,
shall be all rendered into one English dialect,
and that this shall, in order of words
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>and in diction, closely approximate to polished
prose. From an Oxford Professor I
should have expected the very opposite
spirit to that which Mr Arnold shows. He
ought to know and feel that one glory of
Greek poetry is its great internal variety.
He admits the principle that old words are
a source of ennoblement for diction, when
he extols the Bible as his standard: for
surely he claims no rhetorical inspiration
for the translators. Words which have
come to us in a sacred connection, no doubt,
gain a sacred hue, but they must not be
allowed to desecrate other old and excellent
words. Mr Arnold informs his Oxford
hearers that ‘his Bibliolatry is perhaps excessive’.
So the public will judge, if he
say that <i>wench</i>, <i>whore</i>, <i>pate</i>, <i>pot</i>, <i>gin</i>, <i>damn</i>,
<i>busybody</i>, <i>audience</i>, <i>principality</i>, <i>generation</i>,
are epical noble words because they are
in the Bible, and that <i>lief</i>, <i>ken</i>, <i>in sooth</i>,
<i>grim</i>, <i>stalwart</i>, <i>gait</i>, <i>guise</i>, <i>eld</i>, <i>hie</i>, <i>erst</i>, are
bad, because they are not there. Nine
times out of ten, what are called ‘poetical’
words, are nothing but antique words, and
are made ignoble by Mr Arnold’s doctrine.
His very arbitrary condemnation of <i>eld</i>,
<i>lief</i>, <i>in sooth</i>, <i>gait</i>, <i>gentle friend</i> in one passage
of mine as ‘bad words’, is probably due to
his monomaniac fancy that there is nothing
quaint and nothing antique in Homer.
Excellent and noble as are these words
which he rebukes, excellent even for Æschylus,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>I should doubt the propriety of using
them in the dialogue of Euripides; on the
level of which he seems to think Homer
to be.</p>

<p class='c005'>2. Our language, especially the Saxon
part of it, abounds with vigorous monosyllabic
verbs, and dissyllabic frequentatives
derived from them, indicative of strong
physical action. For these words (which,
I make no doubt, Mr Arnold regards as
ignoble plebeians), I claim Quiritarian rights:
but I do not wish them to displace patricians
from high service. Such verbs as <i>sweat</i>,
<i>haul</i>, <i>plump</i>, <i>maul</i>, <i>yell</i>, <i>bang</i>, <i>splash</i>, <i>smash</i>,
<i>thump</i>, <i>tug</i>, <i>scud</i>, <i>sprawl</i>, <i>spank</i>, etc., I hold
(in their purely physical sense) to be eminently
epical: for the epic revels in descriptions
of violent action to which they are
suited. Intense muscular exertion in every
form, intense physical action of the surrounding
elements, with intense ascription
or description of size or colour;—together
make up an immense fraction of the poem.
To cut out these words is to emasculate the
epic. Even Pope admits such words. My
eye in turning his pages was just now
caught by: ‘They tug, they sweat’. Who
will say that ‘tug’, ‘sweat’ are admissible,
but ‘bang’, ‘smash’, ‘sputter’ are inadmissible?
Mr Arnold resents my saying
that Homer is often homely. He is homely
expressly because he is natural. The epical
diction admits both the gigantesque and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>the homely: it inexorably refuses the conventional,
under which is comprised a vast
mass of what some wrongly call elegant.
But while I justify the use of homely words
in a primary physical, I depreciate them in
a secondary moral sense. Mr Arnold clearly
is dull to this distinction, or he would not
utter against me the following taunt, <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 91:</p>

<p class='c005'>‘<i>To grunt and sweat under a weary load</i>
does perfectly well where it comes in Shakspeare:
but if the translator of Homer,
who will hardly have wound up our minds
to the pitch at which these words of Hamlet
find them, were to employ, when he has to
speak of Homer’s heroes under the load of
calamity, this figure of “grunting” and
“sweating”, we should say, <i>He Newmanizes</i>’.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mr Arnold here not only makes a mistake,
he propagates a slander; as if I had ever
used such words as <i>grunt</i> and <i>sweat</i> morally.
If Homer in the Iliad spoke of grunting
swine, as he does of sweating steeds, so
should I. As the coarse metaphors here
quoted from Shakspeare are utterly opposed
to Homer’s style, to obtrude them on him
would be a gross offence. Mr Arnold sends
his readers away with the belief that this
is my practice, though he has not dared to
assert it. I <i>bear</i> such coarseness in Shakspeare,
not because I am ‘wound up to a
high pitch’ by him, ‘borne away by a
mighty current’ (which Mr Arnold, with
ingenious unfairness to me, assumes to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>certain in a reader of Shakspeare and all
but impossible in a reader of Homer), but
because I know, that in Shakspeare’s time
all literature was coarse, as was the speech
of courtiers and of the queen herself. Mr
Arnold imputes to me Shakspeare’s coarseness,
from which I instinctively shrink;
and when his logic leads to the conclusion,
‘he Shakspearizes’, he with gratuitous
rancour turns it into ‘he Newmanizes’.</p>

<p class='c005'>Some words which with the Biblical translators
seem to have been noble, I should not
now dare to use in the primitive sense. For
instance, ‘His iniquity shall fall upon his
own <i>pate</i>’. Yet I think <i>pate</i> a good metaphorical
word and have used it of the sea-waves,
in a bold passage, <abbr title='iliad'>Il.</abbr> 13, 795:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Then ón rush’d théy, with weight and mass &#8196;&#8196;&#8196; like to a troublous whirlwind,</div>
      <div class='line'>Which from the thundercloud of Jove &#8196;&#8196;&#8196; down on the campaign plumpeth,</div>
      <div class='line'>And doth the briny flood bestir &#8196;&#8196;&#8196; with an unearthly uproar:</div>
      <div class='line'>Then in the everbrawling sea &#8196;&#8196;&#8196; full many a billow splasheth,</div>
      <div class='line'>Hollow, and bald with hoary <i>pate</i>, &#8196;&#8196;&#8196; one racing after other.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Is there really no ‘mighty current’ here,
to sweep off petty criticism?</p>

<p class='c005'>I have a remark on the strong physical
word ‘plumpeth’ here used. It is fundamentally
Milton’s, ‘plump down he drops
ten thousand fathom deep’; <i>plumb</i> and
<i>plump</i> in this sense are clearly the same
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>root. I confess I have not been able to
find the <i>verb</i> in an old writer, though it is
so common now. Old writers do not say
‘to plumb down’, but ‘to <i>drop</i> plumb down’.
Perhaps in a second edition (if I reach to it),
I may alter the words to ‘plumb ... droppeth’,
on this ground; but I do turn sick
at the mawkishness of critics, one of whom,
who ought to know better, tells me that the
word <i>plump</i> reminds him ‘of the crinolined
hoyden of a boarding-school’!! If he had
said, ‘It is too like the phrase of a sailor,
of a peasant, of a schoolboy’, this objection
would be at least intelligible. However:
the word is intended to express the <i>violent
impact of a body descending from aloft</i>, and
it <i>does</i> express it.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mr Arnold censures me for representing
Achilles as <i>yelling</i>. He is depicted by the
poet as in the most violent physical rage,
boiling over with passion and wholly uncontrouled.
He smacks his two thighs at once;
he rolls on the ground, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μέγας μεγαλωστὶ</span>;
he defiles his hair with dust; he rends it;
he grinds his teeth; fire flashes from his
eyes; but—he may not ‘yell’, that would
not be <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>comme il faut</i></span>! We shall agree,
that in peace nothing so becomes a hero as
modest stillness; but that ‘Peleus’ son,
insatiate of combat’, full of the fiercest
pent-up passion, should vent a little of it in
a <i>yell</i>, seems to me quite in place. That
the Greek <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἰάχων</span> is not necessarily to be so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>rendered, I am aware; but it is a very
vigorous word, like <i>peal</i> and <i>shriek</i>; neither
of which would here suit. I sometimes
render it <i>skirl</i>: but ‘battle-yell’ is a received
rightful phrase. Achilles is not a
stately Virgilian <i>pius Æneas</i>, but is a far
wilder barbarian.</p>

<p class='c005'>After Mr Arnold has laid upon me the
sins of Shakspeare, he amazes me by adding,
<abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 92: ‘The idiomatic language of Shakspeare,
such language as “prate of his <i>whereabout</i>”,
“<i>jump</i> the life to come”, “the
damnation of his <i>taking-off</i>”, “<i>quietus make</i>
with a bare bodkin”, should be carefully
observed by the translator of Homer; although
in every case he will have to decide
for himself, whether the use, by him, of
Shakspeare’s liberty, will or will not clash
with his indispensable duty of nobleness’.</p>

<p class='c005'>Of the Shakspearianisms here italicized by
Mr Arnold, there is not one which I could
endure to adopt. ‘His whereabout’, I
regard as the flattest prose. (The word
<i>prate</i> is a plebeian which I admit in its own
low places; but how Mr Arnold can approve
of it, consistently with his attacks on me,
I do not understand.) Damnation and
Taking-off (for Guilt and Murder), and Jump,
I absolutely reject; and ‘quietus make’
would be nothing but an utterly inadmissible
<i>quotation</i> from Shakspeare. <i>Jump</i> as an
active verb is to me monstrous, but <i>Jump</i>
is just the sort of modern prose word which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>is not noble. <i>Leap</i>, <i>Bound</i>, for great action,
<i>Skip</i>, <i>Frisk</i>, <i>Gambol</i> for smaller, are all
good.</p>

<p class='c005'>I have shown against Mr Arnold—(1) that
Homer was out-and-out antiquated to the
Athenians, even when perfectly understood
by them; (2) that his conceptions, similes,
phraseology and epithets are habitually
quaint, strange, unparalleled in Greek literature;
and pardonable only to semibarbarism;
(3) that they are intimately related
to his noblest excellences; (4) that many
words are so peculiar as to be still doubtful
to us; (5) I have indicated that some of his
descriptions and conceptions are horrible to
us, though they are not so to his barbaric
auditors; (6) that considerable portions of
the poem are not poetry, but rhythmical
prose like Horace’s Satires, and are interesting
to us not as poetry but as portraying
the manners or sentiments of the day. I
now add (7) what is inevitable in all high
and barbaric poetry, perhaps in all high
poetry, many of his energetic descriptions
are expressed in <i>coarse physical words</i>. I
do not here attempt proof, for it might need
a treatise: but I give one illustration; <abbr title='iliad'>Il.</abbr>
13, 136, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Τρῶες προὒτυψαν ἀολλέες</span>. Cowper,
misled by the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ignis fatuus</i></span> of ‘stateliness’,
renders it absurdly</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>The pow’rs of Ilium</i> gave the first assault,</div>
      <div class='line'><i>Embattled</i> close;</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>but it is strictly, ‘The Trojans <i>knocked-forward</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>(or, thumped, <i>butted</i>, forward) in
close pack’. The verb is too coarse for
later polished prose, and even the adjective
is very strong (<i>packed together</i>). I believe,
that ‘Forward in <i>pack</i> the Troians <i>pitch’d</i>’,
would not be really unfaithful to the Homeric
colour; and I maintain that ‘Forward in
mass the Troians pitch’d’, would be an irreprovable
rendering.</p>

<p class='c005'>Dryden in this respect is in entire harmony
with Homeric style. No critic deals
fairly with me in isolating any of these
strong words, and then appealing to his
readers whether I am not ignoble. Hereby
he deprives me of the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀγὼν</span>, the ‘mighty
current’ of Mr Arnold, and he misstates
the problem; which is, whether the word
is suitable, <i>then</i> and <i>there</i>, for the work required
of it, as the coalman at the pit, the
clown in the furrow, the huntsman in the
open field.</p>

<p class='c005'>3. There is a small number of words not
natural plebeians, but patricians on which
a most unjust bill of attainder has been
passed, which I seek to reverse. On the
first which I name, Mr Arnold will side with
me, because it is a Biblical word, <i>wench</i>.
In Lancashire I believe that at the age
of about sixteen a ‘girl’ turns into ‘a
wench’, or as we say ‘a young woman’.
In Homer, ‘girl’ and ‘young woman’ are
alike inadmissible; ‘maid’ or ‘maiden’
will not always suit, and ‘wench’ is the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>natural word. I do not know that I have
used it three times, but I claim a right of
using it, and protest against allowing the
heroes of slang to deprive us of excellent
words by their perverse misuse. If the
imaginations of some men are always in
satire and in low slang, so much the worse
for them: but the more we yield to such
demands, the more will be exacted. I expect,
before long, to be told that <i>brick</i> is an
ignoble word, meaning a jolly fellow, and
that <i>sell</i>, <i>cut</i> are out of place in Homer.
My metre, it seems, is inadmissible with
some, because it is the metre of Yankee
Doodle! as if Homer’s metre were not that
of the Margites. Every noble poem is liable
to be travestied, as the Iliad and Æschylus
and Shakspeare have been. Every burlesque
writer uses the noble metre, and caricatures
the noble style. Mr Arnold says,
I must not render τανύπεπλος ‘trailing-rob’d’,
because it reminds him of ‘long
petticoats sweeping a dirty pavement’.
What a confession as to the state of his
imagination! Why not, of ‘a queen’s robe
trailing on a marble pavement’? Did he
never read</p>

<p class='c008'>I have digressed: I return to words
which have been misunderstood. A second
word is of more importance, <i>Imp</i>; which
properly means a Graft. The best translation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὦ Λήδας ἔρνος</span> to my mind, is,
‘O Imp of Leda’! for neither ‘bud of
Leda’, nor ‘scion of Leda’ satisfy me:
much less ‘sprig’ or ‘shoot of Leda’. The
theological writers so often used the phrase
‘imp of Satan’ for ‘child of the devil’,
that (since Bunyan?) the vulgar no longer
understand that <i>imp</i> means <i>scion</i>, <i>child</i>,
and suppose it to mean ‘little devil’. A
Reviewer has omitted to give his unlearned
readers any explanation of the word (though
I carefully explained it) and calls down their
indignation upon me by his censures, which
I hope proceeded from carelessness and
ignorance.</p>

<p class='c005'>Even in Spenser’s Fairy Queen the word
retains its rightful and noble sense:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Well worthy <i>imp</i>! then said the lady, etc.,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>and in North’s Plutarch,</p>

<p class='c005'>‘He took upon him to protect him from
them all, and not to suffer so goodly an <i>imp</i>
[Alcibiades] to lose the good fruit of his
youth’.</p>

<p class='c005'>Dryden uses the verb, To imp; to graft,
insert.</p>

<p class='c005'>I was quite aware that I claimed of my
readers a certain strength of mind, when
I bid them to forget the defilements which
vulgarity has shed over the noble word Imp,
and carry their imaginations back two or
three centuries: but I did not calculate
that any critic would call Dainty grotesque.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>This word is equivalent in meaning to Delicate
and Nice, but has precisely the epical
character in which both those words are
deficient. For instance, I say, that after
the death of Patroclus, the coursers ‘stood
motionless’,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Drooping tōwārd the ground their heads, &#8196;&#8196;&#8196; and down their plaintive eyelids</div>
      <div class='line'>Did warm tears trickle to the ground, &#8196;&#8196;&#8196; their charioteer bewailing.</div>
      <div class='line'>Defilèd were their <i>dainty</i> manes, &#8196;&#8196;&#8196; over the yoke-strap dropping.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>A critic who objects to this, has to learn
English from my translation. Does he
imagine that Dainty can mean nothing but
‘over-particular as to food’?</p>

<p class='c005'>In the compound Dainty-cheek’d, Homer
shows his own epic peculiarity. It is imitated
in the similar word <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">εὐπάρᾳος</span> applied
to the Gorgon Medusa by Pindar: but not
in the Attics. I have somewhere read, that
the rudest conception of female beauty is
that of a brilliant red <i>plump</i> cheek; such
as an English clown admires (was this what
Pindar meant?); the second stage looks
to the delicacy of tint in the cheek (this
is Homer’s <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">καλλιπάρῃος</span>:) the third looks
to shape (this is the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">εὒμορφος</span> of the Attics,
the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>formosus</i></span> of the Latins, and is seen in the
Greek sculpture); the fourth and highest
looks to moral expression: this is the idea
of Christian Europe. That Homer rests exclusively
in the second or semibarbaric
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>stage, it is not for me to say, but, as far
as I am able, to give to the readers of my
translation materials for their own judgment.
From the vague word <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">εἶδος</span>, <i>species</i>, <i>appearance</i>,
it cannot be positively inferred whether
the poet had an eye for Shape. The epithets
curl-eyed and fine-ankled decidedly suggest
that he had; except that his application of
the former to the entire nation of the Greeks
makes it seem to be of foreign tradition,
and as unreal as brazen-<i>mailed</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>Another word which has been ill-understood
and ill-used, is <i>dapper</i>. Of the epithet
dappergreav’d for <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐϋκνημὶς</span> I certainly am
not enamoured, but I have not yet found a
better rendering. It is easier to carp at my
phrase, than to suggest a better. The word
<i>dapper</i> in Dutch = German <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><i>tapfer</i></span>; and like
the Scotch <i>braw</i> or <i>brave</i> means with us <i>fine</i>,
<i>gallant</i>, <i>elegant</i>. I have read the line of an
old poet,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The dapper words which lovers use,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>for <i>elegant</i>, I suppose; and so ‘the dapper
does’ and ‘dapper elves’ of Milton must
refer to elegance or refined beauty. What
is there<a id='r54' /><a href='#f54' class='c009'><sup>[54]</sup></a> ignoble in such a word? ‘Elegant’
and ‘pretty’ are inadmissible in epic
poetry: ‘dapper’ is logically equivalent,
and <i>has the epic colour</i>. Neither ‘fair’ nor
‘comely’ here suit. As to the school translation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>of ‘wellgreav’d’, every common
Englishman on hearing the sound receives
it as ‘wellgrieved’, and to me it is very
unpleasing. A part of the mischief, a large
part of it, is in the word <i>greave</i>; for <i>dapper-girdled</i>
is on the whole well-received. But
what else can we say for <i>greave</i>? leggings?
gambados?</p>

<p class='c005'>Much perhaps remains to be learnt concerning
Homer’s perpetual epithets. My
very learned colleague Goldstücke, Professor
of Sanscrit, is convinced that the
epithet <i>cow-eyed</i> of the Homeric Juno is an
echo of the notion of Hindoo poets, that
(if I remember his statement) ‘the sun-beams
are the <i>cows</i> of heaven’. The sacred
qualities of the Hindoo cow are perhaps not
to be forgotten. I have myself been struck
by the phrase <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">διϊπετέος ποτάμοιο</span> as akin
to the idea that the Ganges falls from
Mount Meru, the Hindoo Olympus. Also
the meaning of two other epithets has been
revealed to me from the pictures of Hindoo
ladies. First, <i>curl-eyed</i>, to which I have
referred above; secondly, <i>rosy-fingered
Aurora</i>. For Aurora is an ‘Eastern lady’;
and, as such, has the tips of her fingers dyed
rosy-red, whether by henna or by some
more brilliant drug. Who shall say that
the kings and warriors of Homer do not derive
from the East their epithet ‘Jove-nurtured’?
or that this or that goddess
is not called ‘golden-throned’ or ‘fair-throned’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>in allusion to Assyrian sculptures
or painting, as Rivers probably drew their
later poetical attribute ‘bull-headed’ from
the sculpture of fountains? It is a familiar
remark, that Homer’s poetry presupposes
a vast pre-existing art and material. Much
in him was traditional. Many of his wild
legends came from Asia. He is to us much
beside a poet; and that a translator
should assume to cut him down to the
standard of modern taste, is a thought
which all the higher minds of this age have
outgrown. How much better is that reverential
Docility, which with simple and
innocent wonder, receives the oddest notions
of antiquity as material of instruction yet
to be revealed, than the self-complacent
Criticism, which pronouncing everything
against modern taste to be grotesque<a id='r55' /><a href='#f55' class='c009'><sup>[55]</sup></a> and
contemptible, squares the facts to its own
‘Axioms’! <i>Homer is noble: but this or
that epithet is not noble: therefore we must
explode it from Homer!</i> I value, I maintain,
I struggle for the ‘high a priori road’ in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>its own place; but certainly not in historical
literature. To read Homer’s own thoughts
is to wander in a world abounding with freshness:
but if we insist on treading round and
round in our own footsteps, we shall never
ascend those heights whence the strange
region is to be seen. Surely an intelligent
learned critic ought to inculcate on the unlearned,
that if they would get instruction
from Homer, they must not expect to have
their ears tickled by a musical sound as of a
namby-pamby poetaster; but must look on
a metre as doing its duty, when it ‘strings
the mind up to the necessary pitch’ in
elevated passages; and that instead of demanding
of a translator everywhere a rhythmical
perfection which perhaps can only be
attained by a great sacrifice of higher qualities,
they should be willing to submit to
a small part of that ruggedness, which Mr
Arnold cheerfully bears in Homer himself
through the loss of the Digamma. And
now, for a final protest. To be <i>stately</i> is
not to be <i>grand</i>. Nicolas of Russia may
have been stately like Cowper, Garibaldi is
grand like the true Homer. A diplomatic
address is stately; it is not grand, nor often
noble. To expect a translation of Homer
to be <i>pervadingly elegant</i>, is absurd; Homer
is not such, any more than is the side of an
Alpine mountain. The elegant and the
picturesque are seldom identical, however
much of delicate beauty may be interstudded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>in the picturesque; but this has always got
plenty of what is shaggy and uncouth, without
which contrast the full delight of beauty
would not be attained. I think Moore in
his characteristic way tells of a beauty</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Shining on, shining on, by no shadow made tender,</div>
      <div class='line'>Till love falls asleep in the sameness of splendour.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Such certainly is not Homer’s. His beauty,
when at its height, is <i>wild</i> beauty: it smells
of the mountain and of the sea. If he be
compared to a noble animal, it is not to such
a spruce rubbed-down Newmarket racer as
our smooth translators would pretend, but
to a wild horse of the Don Cossacks: and
if I, instead of this, present to the reader
nothing but a Dandie Dinmont’s pony, this,
as a first approximation, is a valuable step
towards the true solution.</p>

<p class='c005'>Before the best translation of the Iliad
of which our language is capable can be
produced, the English public has to unlearn
the false notion of Homer which his <i>deliberately
faithless</i> versifiers have infused. Chapman’s
conceits unfit his translation for
instructing the public, even if his rhythm
‘jolted’ less, if his structure were simpler,
and his dialect more intelligible. My version,
if allowed to be read, will prepare the
public to receive a version better than
mine. I regard it as a question about to
open hereafter, whether a translator of
Homer ought not to adopt the old dissyllabic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span><i>landis</i>, <i>houndis</i>, <i>hartis</i>, etc., instead
of our modern unmelodious <i>lands</i>, <i>hounds</i>,
<i>harts</i>; whether the <i>ye</i> or <i>y</i> before the past
participle may not be restored; the want
of which confounds that participle with the
past tense. Even the final -en of the plural
of verbs (we dancen, they singen, etc.) still
subsists in Lancashire. It deserves consideration
whether by a <i>few</i> such slight
grammatical retrogressions into antiquity
a translator of Homer might not add much
melody to his poem and do good service
to the language.</p>

  <h2 id='reply2' class='c003'>Last Words on Translating Homer <br /> A Reply to Francis W. Newman <br /> By Matthew Arnold</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>‘Multi, qui persequuntur me, et tribulant me: a
testimoniis non declinavi.’</p>
<p class='c004'>Buffon, the great French naturalist, imposed
on himself the rule of steadily abstaining
from all answer to attacks made
upon him. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">‘Je n’ai jamais répondu à
aucune critique’</span>, he said to one of his
friends who, on the occasion of a certain
criticism, was eager to take up arms in his
behalf; <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">‘je n’ai jamais répondu à aucune
critique, et je garderai le même silence sur
celle-ci’</span>. On another occasion, when accused
of plagiarism, and pressed by his
friends to answer, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">‘Il vaut mieux’</span>, he said,
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">‘laisser ces mauvaises gens dans l’incertitude’</span>.
Even when reply to an attack
was made successfully, he disapproved of
it, he regretted that those he esteemed
should make it. Montesquieu, more sensitive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>to criticism than Buffon, had answered,
and successfully answered, an attack made
upon his great work, the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>Esprit des Lois</i></span>,
by the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>Gazetier Janséniste</i></span>. This Jansenist
Gazetteer was a periodical of those times,
a periodical such as other times, also, have
occasionally seen, very pretentious, very
aggressive, and, when the point to be seized
was at all a delicate one, very apt to miss
it. ‘Notwithstanding this example’, said
Buffon, who, as well as Montesquieu, had
been attacked by the Jansenist Gazetteer,
‘notwithstanding this example, I think I
may promise my course will be different.
I shall not answer a single word’.</p>

<p class='c005'>And to anyone who has noticed the baneful
effects of the controversy, with all its
train of personal rivalries and hatreds, on
men of letters or men of science; to anyone
who has observed how it tends to impair,
not only their dignity and repose, but
their productive force, their genuine activity;
how it always checks the free play
of the spirit, and often ends by stopping
it altogether; it can hardly seem doubtful
that the rule thus imposed on himself by
Buffon was a wise one. His own career,
indeed, admirably shows the wisdom of it.
That career was as glorious as it was serene;
but it owed to its serenity no small part of
its glory. The regularity and completeness
with which he gradually built up the great
work which he had designed, the air of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>equable majesty which he shed over it,
struck powerfully the imagination of his
contemporaries, and surrounded Buffon’s
fame with a peculiar respect and dignity.
‘He is’, said Frederick the Great of him,
‘the man who has best deserved the great
celebrity which he has acquired’. And this
regularity of production, this equableness
of temper, he maintained by his resolute
disdain of personal controversy.</p>

<p class='c005'>Buffon’s example seems to me worthy of
all imitation, and in my humble way I mean
always to follow it. I never have replied,
I never will reply, to any literary assailant;
in such encounters tempers are lost, the
world laughs, and truth is not served.
Least of all should I think of using this
Chair as a place from which to carry on
such a conflict. But when a learned and
estimable man thinks he has reason to complain
of language used by me in this Chair,
when he attributes to me intentions and
feelings towards him which are far from
my heart, I owe him some explanation,
and I am bound, too, to make the explanation
as public as the words which gave
offence. This is the reason why I revert
once more to the subject of translating
Homer. But being thus brought back to
that subject, and not wishing to occupy
you solely with an explanation which, after
all, is Mr Newman’s affair and mine, not
the public’s, I shall take the opportunity,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>not certainly to enter into any conflict with
anyone, but to try to establish our old friend,
the coming translator of Homer, yet a little
firmer in the positions which I hope we have
now secured for him; to protect him against
the danger of relaxing, in the confusion of
dispute, his attention to those matters which
alone I consider important for him; to save
him from losing sight, in the dust of the
attacks delivered over it, of the real body
of Patroclus. He will, probably, when he
arrives, requite my solicitude very ill, and
be in haste to disown his benefactor: but
my interest in him is so sincere that I can
disregard his probable ingratitude.</p>

<p class='c005'>First, however, for the explanation. Mr
Newman has published a reply to the remarks
which I made on his translation of the <i>Iliad</i>.
He seems to think that the respect which at
the outset of those remarks I professed for
him must have been professed ironically;
he says that I use ‘forms of attack against
him which he does not know how to characterize’;
that I ‘speak scornfully’ of him,
treat him with ‘gratuitous insult, gratuitous
rancour’; that I ‘propagate slanders’
against him, that I wish to ‘damage him
with my readers’, to ‘stimulate my readers
to despise’ him. He is entirely mistaken.
I respect Mr Newman sincerely; I respect
him as one of the few learned men we have,
one of the few who love learning for its own
sake; this respect for him I had before I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>read his translation of the <i>Iliad</i>, I retained
it while I was commenting on that translation,
I have not lost it after reading his
reply. Any vivacities of expression which
may have given him pain I sincerely regret,
and can only assure him that I used them
without a thought of insult or rancour.
When I took the liberty of creating the
verb <i>to Newmanize</i>, my intentions were no
more rancorous than if I had said to <i>Miltonize</i>;
when I exclaimed, in my astonishment
at his vocabulary, ‘With whom can Mr
Newman have lived’? I meant merely to
convey, in a familiar form of speech, the
sense of bewilderment one has at finding a
person to whom words one thought all the
world knew seem strange, and words one
thought entirely strange, intelligible. Yet
this simple expression of my bewilderment
Mr Newman construes into an accusation
that he is ‘often guilty of keeping low company’,
and says that I shall ‘never want a
stone to throw at him’. And what is
stranger still, one of his friends gravely
tells me that Mr Newman ‘lived with the
fellows of Balliol’. As if that made Mr
Newman’s glossary less inexplicable to me!
As if he could have got his glossary from
the fellows of Balliol! As if I could believe
that the members of that distinguished
society, of whose discourse, not so many
years afterwards, I myself was an unworthy
hearer, were in Mr Newman’s time so far
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>removed from the Attic purity of speech
which we all of us admired, that when one
of them called a calf a <i>bulkin</i>, the rest ‘easily
understood’ him; or, when he wanted to
say that a newspaper-article was ‘proudly
fine’, it mattered little whether he said it
was that or <i>bragly</i>! No; his having lived
with the fellows of Balliol does not explain
Mr Newman’s glossary to me. I will no
longer ask ‘with whom he can have lived’,
since that gives him offence; but I must
still declare that where he got his test of
rarity or intelligibility for words is a mystery
to me.</p>

<p class='c005'>That, however, does not prevent me from
entertaining a very sincere respect for Mr
Newman, and since he doubts it, I am glad
to reiterate my expression of it. But the
truth of the matter is this: I unfeignedly
admire Mr Newman’s ability and learning;
but I think in his translation of Homer he
has employed that ability and learning quite
amiss. I think he has chosen quite the
wrong field for turning his ability and learning
to account. I think that in England, partly
from the want of an Academy, partly from
a national habit of intellect to which that
want of an Academy is itself due, there
exists too little of what I may call a public
force of correct literary opinion, possessing
within certain limits a clear sense of what
is right and wrong, sound and unsound,
and sharply recalling men of ability and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>learning from any flagrant misdirection of
these their advantages. I think, even, that
in our country a powerful misdirection of
this kind is often more likely to subjugate
and pervert opinion than to be checked
and corrected by it<a id='r56' /><a href='#f56' class='c009'><sup>[56]</sup></a>. Hence a chaos of
false tendencies, wasted efforts, impotent
conclusions, works which ought never to
have been undertaken. Anyone who can
introduce a little order into this chaos by
establishing in any quarter a single sound
rule of criticism, a single rule which clearly
marks what is right as right, and what is
wrong as wrong, does a good deed; and his
deed is so much the better the greater force
he counteracts of learning and ability applied
to thicken the chaos. Of course no
one can be sure that he has fixed any such
rules; he can only do his best to fix them;
but somewhere or other, in the literary
opinion of Europe, if not in the literary
opinion of one nation, in fifty years, if not
in five, there is a final judgment on these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>matters, and the critic’s work will at last
stand or fall by its true merits.</p>

<p class='c005'>Meanwhile, the charge of having in one
instance misapplied his powers, of having
once followed a false tendency, is no such
grievous charge to bring against a man;
it does not exclude a great respect for himself
personally, or for his powers in the
happiest manifestations of them. False
tendency is, I have said, an evil to which
the artist or the man of letters in England
is peculiarly prone; but everywhere in our
time he is liable to it,—the greatest as well
as the humblest. ‘The first beginnings of
my <i>Wilhelm Meister</i>’, says Goethe, ‘arose
out of an obscure sense of the great truth
that man will often attempt something of
which nature has denied him the proper
powers, will undertake and practise something
in which he cannot become skilled.
An inward feeling warns him to desist’
(yes, but there are, unhappily, cases of absolute
judicial blindness!), ‘nevertheless he
cannot get clear in himself about it, and is
driven along a false road to a false goal,
without knowing how it is with him. To
this we may refer everything which goes by
the name of false tendency, dilettanteism,
and so on. A great many men waste in
this way the fairest portion of their lives,
and fall at last into wonderful delusion’.
Yet after all, Goethe adds, it sometimes
happens that even on this false road a man
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>finds, not indeed that which he sought,
but something which is good and useful for
him; ‘like Saul, the son of Kish, who went
forth to look for his father’s asses, and found
a kingdom’. And thus false tendency as
well as true, vain effort as well as fruitful,
go together to produce that great movement
of life, to present that immense and
magic spectacle of human affairs, which
from boyhood to old age fascinates the gaze
of every man of imagination, and which
would be his terror, if it were not at the
same time his delight.</p>

<p class='c005'>So Mr Newman may see how wide-spread
a danger it is, to which he has, as I think,
in setting himself to translate Homer, fallen
a prey. He may be well satisfied if he can
escape from it by paying it the tribute of
a single work only. He may judge how
unlikely it is that I should ‘despise’ him
for once falling a prey to it. I know far
too well how exposed to it we all are; how
exposed to it I myself am. At this very
moment, for example, I am fresh from
reading Mr Newman’s Reply to my Lectures,
a reply full of that erudition in which (as
I am so often and so good-naturedly reminded,
but indeed I know it without being
reminded) Mr Newman is immeasurably my
superior. Well, the demon that pushes us
all to our ruin is even now prompting me
to follow Mr Newman into a discussion
about the digamma, and I know not what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>providence holds me back. And some day,
I have no doubt, I shall lecture on the
language of the Berbers, and give him his
entire revenge.</p>

<p class='c005'>But Mr Newman does not confine himself
to complaints on his own behalf, he complains
on Homer’s behalf too. He says
that my ‘statements about Greek literature
are against the most notorious and elementary
fact’; that I ‘do a public wrong
to literature by publishing them’; and
that the Professors to whom I appealed in
my three Lectures, ‘would only lose credit
if they sanctioned the use I make of their
names’. He does these eminent men the
kindness of adding, however, that ‘whether
they are pleased with this parading of their
names in behalf of paradoxical error, he
may well doubt’, and that ‘until they endorse
it themselves, he shall treat my process
as a piece of forgery’. He proceeds
to discuss my statements at great length,
and with an erudition and ingenuity which
nobody can admire more than I do. And
he ends by saying that my ignorance is great.</p>

<p class='c005'>Alas! that is very true. Much as Mr
Newman was mistaken when he talked of
my rancour, he is entirely right when he
talks of my ignorance. And yet, perverse
as it seems to say so, I sometimes find myself
wishing, when dealing with these matters
of poetical criticism, that my ignorance
were even greater than it is. To handle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>these matters properly there is needed a
poise so perfect that the least overweight
in any direction tends to destroy the balance.
Temper destroys it, a crotchet destroys
it, even erudition may destroy it.
To press to the sense of the thing itself with
which one is dealing, not to go off on some
collateral issue about the thing, is the hardest
matter in the world. The ‘thing itself’
with which one is here dealing, the critical
perception of poetic truth, is of all things
the most volatile, elusive, and evanescent;
by even pressing too impetuously after it,
one runs the risk of losing it. The critic
of poetry should have the finest tact, the
nicest moderation, the most free, flexible,
and elastic spirit imaginable; he should be
indeed the ‘ondoyant et divers’, the <i>undulating
and diverse</i> being of Montaigne.
The less he can deal with his object simply
and freely, the more things he has to take
into account in dealing with it, the more,
in short, he has to encumber himself, so
much the greater force of spirit he needs
to retain his elasticity. But one cannot
exactly have this greater force by wishing
for it; so, for the force of spirit one has,
the load put upon it is often heavier than it
will well bear. The late Duke of Wellington
said of a certain peer that ‘it was a great
pity his education had been so far too much
for his abilities’. In like manner, one often
sees erudition out of all proportion to its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>owner’s critical faculty. Little as I know,
therefore, I am always apprehensive, in
dealing with poetry, lest even that little
should prove ‘too much for my abilities’.</p>

<p class='c005'>With this consciousness of my own lack
of learning, nay, with this sort of acquiescence
in it, with this belief that for the
labourer in the field of poetical criticism
learning has its disadvantages, I am not
likely to dispute with Mr Newman about
matters of erudition. All that he says on
these matters in his Reply I read with great
interest; in general I agree with him; but
only, I am sorry to say, up to a certain
point. Like all learned men, accustomed
to desire definite rules, he draws his conclusions
too absolutely; he wants to include
too much under his rules; he does not quite
perceive that in poetical criticism the shade,
the fine distinction, is everything; and that,
when he has once missed this, in all he says
he is in truth but beating the air. For instance:
because I think Homer noble, he
imagines I must think him elegant; and
in fact he says in plain words that I do
think him so, that to me Homer seems
‘pervadingly elegant’. But he does not.
Virgil is elegant, ‘pervadingly elegant’,
even in passages of the highest emotion:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in28'>O, ubi campi,</div>
      <div class='line'>Spercheosque, et virginibus bacchata Lacænis</div>
      <div class='line'>Taygeta<a id='r57' /><a href='#f57' class='c009'><sup>[57]</sup></a>!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>Even there Virgil, though of a divine elegance,
is still elegant, but Homer is not
elegant; the word is quite a wrong one
to apply to him, and Mr Newman is quite
right in blaming anyone he finds so applying
it. Again; arguing against my assertion
that Homer is not quaint, he says:
‘It is quaint to call waves <i>wet</i>, milk <i>white</i>,
blood <i>dusky</i>, horses <i>single-hoofed</i>, words
winged, Vulcan <i>Lobfoot</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Κυλλοποδίων</span>), a
spear <i>longshadowy</i>‘, and so on. I find I
know not how many distinctions to draw
here. I do not think it quaint to call
waves <i>wet</i>, or milk <i>white</i>, or words <i>winged</i>;
but I do think it quaint to call horses <i>single-hoofed</i>,
or Vulcan <i>Lobfoot</i>, or a spear <i>longshadowy</i>.
As to calling blood <i>dusky</i>, I do
not feel quite sure; I will tell Mr Newman
my opinion when I see the passage in which
he calls it so. But then, again, because it
is quaint to call Vulcan <i>Lobfoot</i>, I cannot
admit that it was quaint to call him <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Κυλλοποδίων</span>;
nor that, because it is quaint to
call a spear <i>longshadowy</i>, it was quaint to
call it <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δολιχόσκιον</span>. Here Mr Newman’s
erudition misleads him: he knows the
literal value of the Greek so well, that he
thinks his literal rendering identical with
the Greek, and that the Greek must stand
or fall along with his rendering. But the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>real question is, not whether he has given
us, so to speak, full change for the Greek,
but <i>how</i> he gives us our change: we want
it in gold, and he gives it us in copper.
Again: ‘It is quaint’, says Mr Newman,
‘to address a young friend as “O Pippin”!
it is quaint to compare Ajax to an ass whom
boys are belabouring’. Here, too, Mr Newman
goes much too fast, and his category of
quaintness is too comprehensive. To address
a young friend as ‘O Pippin’! is, I
cordially agree with him, very quaint; although
I do not think it was quaint in
Sarpedon to address Glaucus as ὦ πέπον:
but in comparing, whether in Greek or in
English, Ajax to an ass whom boys are
belabouring, I do not see that there is of
necessity anything quaint at all. Again;
because I said that <i>eld</i>, <i>lief</i>, <i>in sooth</i>, and
other words, are, as Mr Newman uses them
in certain places, bad words, he imagines
that I must mean to stamp these words
with an absolute reprobation; and because
I said that ‘my Bibliolatry is excessive’,
he imagines that I brand all words as ignoble
which are not in the Bible. Nothing of the
kind: there are no such absolute rules to
be laid down in these matters. The Bible
vocabulary is to be used as an assistance,
not as an authority. Of the words which,
placed where Mr Newman places them, I
have called bad words, everyone may be
excellent in some other place. Take <i>eld</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>for instance: when Shakspeare, reproaching
man with the dependence in which his youth
is passed, says:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in12'>all thy blessed youth</div>
      <div class='line'>Becomes as aged, and doth beg the alms</div>
      <div class='line'>Of palsied <i>eld</i>, ...</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>it seems to me that <i>eld</i> comes in excellently
there, in a passage of curious meditation;
but when Mr Newman renders <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀγήρω τ’
ἀθανάτω τε</span> by ‘from <i>Eld</i> and Death exempted’,
it seems to me he infuses a tinge
of quaintness into the transparent simplicity
of Homer’s expression, and so I call <i>eld</i> a
bad word in that place.</p>

<p class='c005'>Once more. Mr Newman lays it down
as a general rule that ‘many of Homer’s
energetic descriptions are expressed in coarse
physical words’. He goes on: ‘I give
one illustration,—<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Τρῶες προὔτυψαν ἀολλέες</span>.
Cowper, misled by the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ignis fatuus</i></span> of
“stateliness” renders it absurdly:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The powers of Ilium gave the first assault</div>
      <div class='line'>Embattled close;</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>but it is, strictly, “The Trojans <i>knocked
forward</i> (or, thumped, butted forward) <i>in
close pack</i>”. The verb is too coarse for
later polished prose, and even the adjective
is very strong (<i>packed together</i>). I believe
that “forward in pack the Trojans pitched”,
would not be really unfaithful to the Homeric
colour; and I maintain that “forward in
mass the Trojans pitched”, would be an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>irreprovable rendering’. He actually gives
us all that as if it were a piece of scientific
deduction; and as if, at the end, he had
arrived at an incontrovertible conclusion.
But, in truth, one cannot settle these matters
quite in this way. Mr Newman’s general
rule may be true or false (I dislike to meddle
with general rules), but every part in what
follows must stand or fall by itself, and its
soundness or unsoundness has nothing at
all to do with the truth or falsehood of Mr
Newman’s general rule. He first gives, as
a strict rendering of the Greek, ‘The Trojans
knocked forward (or, thumped, butted forward),
in close pack’. I need not say that,
as a ‘strict rendering of the Greek’, this is
good; all Mr Newman’s ‘strict renderings of
the Greek’ are sure to be, as such, good;
but ‘in close pack’, for <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀολλέες</span>, seems to
me to be what Mr Newman’s renderings are
not always,—an excellent <i>poetical rendering</i>
of the Greek; a thousand times better,
certainly, than Cowper’s ‘embattled close’.
Well, but Mr Newman goes on: ‘I believe
that, “forward in pack the Trojans pitched”,
would not be really unfaithful to the
Homeric colour’. Here, I say, the Homeric
colour is half washed out of Mr Newman’s
happy rendering of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀολλέες</span>; while in
‘pitched’ for <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">προὔτυψαν</span>, the literal fidelity
of the first rendering is gone, while certainly
no Homeric colour has come in its place.
Finally, Mr Newman concludes: ‘I maintain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>that “forward in mass the Trojans pitched”,
would be an irreprovable rendering’. Here,
in what Mr Newman fancies his final moment
of triumph, Homeric colour and literal
fidelity have alike abandoned him altogether;
the last stage of his translation is
much worse than the second, and immeasurably
worse than the first.</p>

<p class='c005'>All this to show that a looser, easier
method than Mr Newman’s must be taken,
if we are to arrive at any good result in
these questions. I now go on to follow Mr
Newman a little further, not at all as wishing
to dispute with him, but as seeking (and this
is the true fruit we may gather from criticisms
upon us) to gain hints from him for
the establishment of some useful truth
about our subject, even when I think him
wrong. I still retain, I confess, my conviction
that Homer’s characteristic qualities
are rapidity of movement, plainness of words
and style, simplicity and directness of ideas,
and, above all, nobleness, the grand manner.
Whenever Mr Newman drops a word,
awakens a train of thought, which leads me
to see any of these characteristics more
clearly, I am grateful to him; and one or
two suggestions of this kind which he
affords, are all that now, having expressed
my sorrow that he should have misconceived
my feelings towards him, and pointed
out what I think the vice of his method of
criticism, I have to notice in his Reply.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>Such a suggestion I find in Mr Newman’s
remarks on my assertion that the translator
of Homer must not adopt a quaint and
antiquated style in rendering him, because
the impression which Homer makes upon
the living scholar is not that of a poet
quaint and antiquated, but that of a poet
perfectly simple, perfectly intelligible. I
added that we cannot, I confess, really
know how Homer seemed to Sophocles,
but that it is impossible to me to believe
that he seemed to him quaint and antiquated.
Mr Newman asserts, on the other
hand, that I am absurdly wrong here; that
Homer seemed ‘out and out’ quaint and
antiquated to the Athenians; that ‘every
sentence of him was more or less antiquated
to Sophocles, who could no more help
feeling at every instant the foreign and
antiquated character of the poetry than an
Englishman can help feeling the same in
reading Burns’ poems’. And not only
does Mr Newman say this, but he has managed
thoroughly to convince some of his
readers of it. ‘Homer’s Greek’, says one
of them, ‘certainly seemed antiquated to
the historical times of Greece. Mr Newman,
taking a far broader historical and philological
view than Mr Arnold, stoutly maintains
that it did seem so.’ And another says:
‘Doubtless Homer’s dialect and diction were
as hard and obscure to a later Attic Greek
as Chaucer to an Englishman of our day.’</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>Mr Newman goes on to say, that not only
was Homer antiquated relatively to Pericles,
but he is antiquated to the living scholar;
and, indeed, is in himself ‘absolutely antique,
being the poet of a barbarian age’. He
tells us of his ‘inexhaustible quaintnesses’,
of his ‘very eccentric diction’; and he
infers, of course, that he is perfectly right
in rendering him in a quaint and antiquated
style.</p>

<p class='c005'>Now this question, whether or no Homer
seemed quaint and antiquated to Sophocles,
I call a delightful question to raise. It is
not a barren verbal dispute; it is a question
‘drenched in matter’, to use an expression
of Bacon; a question full of flesh and blood,
and of which the scrutiny, though I still
think we cannot settle absolutely, may yet
give us a directly useful result. To scrutinize
it may lead us to see more clearly
what sort of a style a modern translator
of Homer ought to adopt.</p>

<p class='c005'>Homer’s verses were some of the first
words which a young Athenian heard. He
heard them from his mother or his nurse
before he went to school; and at school,
when he went there, he was constantly
occupied with them. So much did he hear
of them that Socrates proposes, in the
interests of morality, to have selections
from Homer made, and placed in the hands
of mothers and nurses, in his model republic;
in order that, of an author with whom they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>were sure to be so perpetually conversant,
the young might learn only those parts
which might do them good. His language
was as familiar to Sophocles, we may be
quite sure, as the language of the Bible is
to us.</p>

<p class='c005'>Nay, more. Homer’s language was not,
of course, in the time of Sophocles, the spoken
or written language of ordinary life, any
more than the language of the Bible, any
more than the language of poetry, is with
us; but for one great species of composition,
epic poetry, it was still the current language;
it was the language in which everyone who
made that sort of poetry composed. Everyone
at Athens who dabbled in epic poetry,
not only understood Homer’s language, he
possessed it. He possessed it as everyone
who dabbles in poetry with us, possesses
what may be called the poetical vocabulary,
as distinguished from the vocabulary of
common speech and of modern prose:
I mean, such expressions as <i>perchance</i> for
<i>perhaps</i>, <i>spake</i> for <i>spoke</i>, <i>aye</i> for <i>ever</i>, <i>don</i>
for <i>put on</i>, <i>charméd</i> for <i>charm’d</i>, and thousands
of others.</p>

<p class='c005'>I might go to Burns and Chaucer, and,
taking words and passages from them, ask
if they afforded any parallel to a language
so familiar and so possessed. But this I
will not do, for Mr Newman himself supplies
me with what he thinks a fair parallel, in
its effect upon us, to the language of Homer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>in its effect upon Sophocles. He says that
such words as <i>mon</i>, <i>londis</i>, <i>libbard</i>, <i>withouten</i>,
<i>muchel</i>, give us a tolerable but incomplete
notion of this parallel; and he finally exhibits
the parallel in all its clearness, by this
poetical specimen:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Dat mon, quhich hauldeth Kyngis af</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Londis yn féo, niver</div>
      <div class='line'>(I tell ’e) feereth aught; sith hee</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Doth hauld hys londis yver.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Now, does Mr Newman really think that
Sophocles could, as he says, ‘no more help
feeling at every instant the foreign and
antiquated character of Homer, than an
Englishman can help feeling the same in
hearing these lines’? Is he quite sure of
it? He says he is; he will not allow of
any doubt or hesitation in the matter. I
had confessed we could not really know
how Homer seemed to Sophocles; ‘Let Mr
Arnold confess for himself’, cries Mr Newman,
‘and not for me, who know perfectly
well’. And this is what he knows!</p>

<p class='c005'>Mr Newman says, however, that I ‘play
fallaciously on the words familiar and unfamiliar’;
that ‘Homer’s words may have
been familiar to the Athenians (<i>i.e.</i> often
heard) even when they were either not
understood by them or else, being understood,
were yet felt and known to be utterly
foreign. Let my renderings’, he continues,
‘be heard, as Pope or even Cowper has been
heard, and no one will be “surprised”’.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>But the whole question is here. The
translator must not assume that to have
taken place which has not taken place,
although, perhaps, he may wish it to have
taken place, namely, that his diction is
become an established possession of the
minds of men, and therefore is, in its proper
place, familiar to them, will not ‘surprise’
them. If Homer’s language was familiar,
that is, often heard, then to his language
words like <i>londis</i> and <i>libbard</i>, which are not
familiar, offer, for the translator’s purpose,
no parallel. For some purpose of the philologer
they may offer a parallel to it; for the
translator’s purpose they offer none. The
question is not, whether a diction is antiquated
for current speech, but whether it
is antiquated for that particular purpose
for which it is employed. A diction that
is antiquated for common speech and common
prose, may very well not be antiquated
for poetry or certain special kinds of prose.
‘Peradventure there shall be ten found
there’, is not antiquated for Biblical prose,
though for conversation or for a newspaper
it is antiquated. ‘The trumpet spake not
to the arméd throng’, is not antiquated for
poetry, although we should not write in a
letter, ‘he <i>spake</i> to me’, or say, ‘the
British soldier is <i>arméd</i> with the Enfield
rifle’. But when language is antiquated
for that particular purpose for which it is
employed, as numbers of Chaucer’s words,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>for instance, are antiquated for poetry,
such language is a bad representative of
language which, like Homer’s, was never
antiquated for that particular purpose for
which it was employed. I imagine that
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Πηληϊάδεω</span> for <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Πηλείδου</span>, in Homer, no
more sounded antiquated to Sophocles, than
<i>arméd</i> for <i>arm’d</i>, in Milton, sounds antiquated
to us; but Mr Newman’s <i>withouten</i>
and <i>muchel</i> do sound to us antiquated, even
for poetry, and therefore they do not correspond
in their effect upon us with Homer’s
words in their effect upon Sophocles. When
Chaucer, who uses such words, is to pass
current amongst us, to be familiar to us,
as Homer was familiar to the Athenians,
he has to be modernized, as Wordsworth
and others set to work to modernize him;
but an Athenian no more needed to have
Homer modernized, than we need to have
the Bible modernized, or Wordsworth himself.</p>

<p class='c005'>Therefore, when Mr Newman’s words
<i>bragly</i>, <i>bulkin</i>, and the rest, are an established
possession of our minds, as Homer’s
words were an established possession of an
Athenian’s mind, he may use them; but not
till then. Chaucer’s words, the words of
Burns, great poets as these were, are yet
not thus an established possession of an
Englishman’s mind, and therefore they
must not be used in rendering Homer into
English.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>Mr Newman has been misled just by
doing that which his admirer praises him
for doing, by taking a ‘far broader historical
and philological view than mine’. Precisely
because he has done this, and has applied
the ‘philological view’ where it was not
applicable, but where the ‘poetical view’
alone was rightly applicable, he has fallen
into error.</p>

<p class='c005'>It is the same with him in his remarks on
the difficulty and obscurity of Homer.
Homer, I say, is perfectly plain in speech,
simple, and intelligible. And I infer from
this that his translator, too, ought to be
perfectly plain in speech, simple, and intelligible;
ought not to say, for instance,
in rendering</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Οὔτε κέ σε στέλλοιμι μάχην ἐς κυδιάνειραν ...</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>‘Nor liefly thee would I advance to man-ennobling
battle’,—and things of that kind.
Mr Newman hands me a list of some twenty
hard words, invokes Buttmann, Mr Malden,
and M. Benfey, and asks me if I think myself
wiser than all the world of Greek scholars,
and if I am ready to supply the deficiencies
of Liddell and Scott’s <i>Lexicon</i>! But here,
again, Mr Newman errs by not perceiving
that the question is not one of scholarship,
but of a poetical translation of Homer.
This, I say, should be perfectly simple and
intelligible. He replies by telling me that
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀδινὸς, εἰλίποδες</span>, and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σιγαλόεις</span> are hard
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>words. Well, but what does he infer from
that? That the poetical translation, in his
rendering of them, is to give us a sense of
the difficulties of the scholar, and so is to
make his translation obscure? If he does
not mean that, how, by bringing forward
these hard words, does he touch the question
whether an English version of Homer should
be plain or not plain? If Homer’s poetry,
as poetry, is in its general effect on the
poetical reader perfectly simple and intelligible,
the uncertainty of the scholar about
the true meaning of certain words can never
change this general effect. Rather will the
poetry of Homer make us forget his philology,
than his philology make us forget his
poetry. It may even be affirmed that everyone
who reads Homer perpetually for the
sake of enjoying his poetry (and no one who
does not so read him will ever translate him
well), comes at last to form a perfectly clear
sense in his own mind for every important
word in Homer, such as <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀδινὸς</span>, or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἠλίβατος</span>,
whatever the scholar’s doubts about the
word may be. And this sense is present
to his mind with perfect clearness and fulness,
whenever the word recurs, although
as a scholar he may know that he cannot
be sure whether this sense is the right one
or not. But poetically he feels clearly
about the word, although philologically he
may not. The scholar in him may hesitate,
like the father in Sheridan’s play; but the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>reader of poetry in him is, like the governor,
fixed. The same thing happens to us with
our own language. How many words occur
in the Bible, for instance, to which thousands
of hearers do not feel sure they attach the
precise real meaning; but they make out
<i>a</i> meaning for them out of what materials
they have at hand; and the words, heard
over and over again, come to convey this
meaning with a certainty which poetically
is adequate, though not philologically. How
many have attached a clear and poetically
adequate sense to ‘<i>the beam</i>’ and ‘<i>the
mote</i>’, though not precisely the right one!
How clearly, again, have readers got a sense
from Milton’s words, ‘grate on their <i>scrannel</i>
pipes’, who yet might have been puzzled
to write a commentary on the word <i>scrannel</i>
for the dictionary! So we get a clear sense
from <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀδινὸs</span> as an epithet for grief, after
often meeting with it and finding out all
we can about it, even though that all be
philologically insufficient; so we get a clear
sense from <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">εἰλίποδες</span> as an epithet for cows.
And this his clear poetical sense about the
words, not his philological uncertainties
about them, is what the translator has to
convey. Words like <i>bragly</i> and <i>bulkin</i> offer
no parallel to these words; because the
reader, from his entire want of familiarity
with the words bragly and bulkin, has no
clear sense of them poetically.</p>

<p class='c005'>Perplexed by his knowledge of the philological
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>aspect of Homer’s language, encumbered
by his own learning, Mr Newman, I
say, misses the poetical aspect, misses that
with which alone we are here concerned.
‘Homer <i>is</i> odd’, he persists, fixing his eyes
on his own philological analysis of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μώνυξ</span>,
and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μέροψς</span>, and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Κυλλοποδίων</span>, and not on
these words in their synthetic character;—just
as Professor Max Müller, going a little
farther back, and fixing his attention on the
elementary value of the word <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θυγάτηρ</span>, might
say Homer was ‘odd’ for using <i>that</i> word;—‘if
the whole Greek nation, by long
familiarity, had become inobservant of
Homer’s oddities’, of the oddities of this
‘noble barbarian’, as Mr Newman elsewhere
calls him, this ‘noble barbarian’ with the
‘lively eye of the savage’, ‘that would be
no fault of mine. That would not justify
Mr Arnold’s blame of me for rendering the
words correctly’. <i>Correctly</i>,—ah, but what
<i>is</i> correctness in this case? This correctness
of his is the very rock on which Mr Newman
has split. He is so correct that at last he
finds peculiarity everywhere. The true
knowledge of Homer becomes at last, in
his eyes, a knowledge of Homer’s ‘peculiarities,
pleasant and unpleasant’. Learned
men know these ‘peculiarities’, and Homer
is to be translated because the unlearned
are impatient to know them too. ‘That’,
he exclaims, ‘is just why people want to
read an English Homer, <i>to know all his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>oddities, just as learned men do</i>’. Here I
am obliged to shake my head, and to declare
that, in spite of all my respect for Mr Newman,
I cannot go these lengths with him.
He talks of my ‘monomaniac fancy that
there is nothing quaint or antique in
Homer’. Terrible learning, I cannot help
in my turn exclaiming, terrible learning,
which discovers so much!</p>

<p class='c005'>Here, then, I take my leave of Mr Newman,
retaining my opinion that his version
of Homer is spoiled by his making Homer
odd and ignoble; but having, I hope,
sufficient love for literature to be able to
canvass works without thinking of persons,
and to hold this or that production cheap,
while retaining a sincere respect, on other
grounds, for its author.</p>

<p class='c005'>In fulfilment of my promise to take this
opportunity for giving the translator of
Homer a little further advice, I proceed to
notice one or two other criticisms which I
find, in like manner, <i>suggestive</i>; which give
us an opportunity, that is, of seeing more
clearly, as we look into them, the true
principles on which translation of Homer
should rest. This is all I seek in criticisms;
and, perhaps (as I have already said) it is
only as one seeks a positive result of this
kind, that one can get any fruit from them.
Seeking a negative result from them, personal
altercation and wrangling, one gets
no fruit; seeking a positive result, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>elucidation and establishment of one’s ideas,
one may get much. Even bad criticisms
may thus be made suggestive and fruitful.
I declared, in a former lecture on this subject,
my conviction that criticism is not the
strong point of our national literature.
Well, even the bad criticisms on our present
topic which I meet with, serve to illustrate
this conviction for me. And thus one is
enabled, even in reading remarks which for
Homeric criticism, for their immediate subject,
have no value, which are far too personal
in spirit, far too immoderate in temper,
and far too heavy-handed in style, for the
delicate matter they have to treat, still to
gain light and confirmation for a serious
idea, and to follow the Baconian injunction,
<i>semper aliquid addiscere</i>, always to be adding
to one’s stock of observation and knowledge.
Yes, even when we have to do with
writers who, to quote the words of an exquisite
critic, the master of us all in criticism,
M. Sainte-Beuve, remind us, when they
handle such subjects as our present, of
‘Romans of the fourth or fifth century,
coming to hold forth, all at random, in
African style, on papers found in the desk
of Augustus, Mæcenas, or Pollio’, even then
we may instruct ourselves if we may regard
ideas and not persons; even then we may
enable ourselves to say, with the same critic
describing the effect made upon him by
D’Argenson’s <i>Memoirs</i>: ‘My taste is revolted,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>but I learn something; <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>Je suis
choqué mais je suis instruit</i></span>’.</p>

<p class='c005'>But let us pass to criticisms which are
suggestive directly and not thus indirectly
only, criticisms by examining which we may
be brought nearer to what immediately interests
us, the right way of translating
Homer.</p>

<p class='c005'>I said that Homer did not rise and sink
with his subject, was never to be called
prosaic and low. This gives surprise to
many persons, who object that parts of
the <i>Iliad</i> are certainly pitched lower than
others, and who remind me of a number
of absolutely level passages in Homer. But
I never denied that a <i>subject</i> must rise and
sink, that it must have its elevated and its
level regions; all I deny is, that a poet
can be said to rise and sink when all that
he, as a poet, can do, is perfectly well done;
when he is perfectly sound and good, that
is, perfect as a poet, in the level regions of
his subject as well as in its elevated regions.
Indeed, what distinguishes the greatest
masters of poetry from all others is, that
they are perfectly sound and poetical in
these level regions of their subject, in these
regions which are the great difficulty of all
poets but the very greatest, which they
never quite know what to do with. A poet
may sink in these regions by being falsely
grand as well as by being low; he sinks,
in short, whenever he does not treat his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>matter, whatever it is, in a perfectly good
and poetic way. But, so long as he treats
it in this way, he cannot be said to <i>sink</i>,
whatever his matter may do. A passage
of the simplest narrative is quoted to me
from Homer:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὤτρυνεν δὲ ἕκαστον ἐποιχόμενος ἐπέεσσιν,</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Μέσθλην τε, Γλαῦκόν τε, Μέδοντά τε, θερσιλοχόν τε</span> ...<a id='r58' /><a href='#f58' class='c009'><sup>[58]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>and I am asked, whether Homer does not
sink <i>there</i>; whether he ‘<i>can</i> have intended
such lines as those for poetry’? My answer
is: Those lines are very good poetry indeed,
poetry of the best class, <i>in that place</i>. But
when Wordsworth, having to narrate a very
plain matter, tries <i>not</i> to sink in narrating
it, tries, in short, to be what is falsely called
poetical, he does sink, although he sinks
by being pompous, not by being low.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Onward we drove beneath the Castle; caught,</div>
      <div class='line'>While crossing Magdalen Bridge, a glimpse of Cam,</div>
      <div class='line'>And at the Hoop alighted, famous inn.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>That last line shows excellently how a poet
may sink with his subject by resolving not
to sink with it. A page or two farther on,
the subject rises to grandeur, and then
Wordsworth is nobly worthy of it:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The antechapel, where the statue stood</div>
      <div class='line'>Of Newton with his prism and silent face,</div>
      <div class='line'>The marble index of a mind for ever</div>
      <div class='line'>Voyaging through strange seas of thought, alone.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>But the supreme poet is he who is thoroughly
sound and poetical, alike when his subject
is grand, and when it is plain: with him
the subject may sink, but never the poet.
But a Dutch painter does not rise and sink
with his subject; Defoe, in <i>Moll Flanders</i>,
does not rise and sink with his subject,
in so far as an artist cannot be said to sink
who is sound in his treatment of his subject,
however plain it is: yet Defoe, yet a Dutch
painter, may in one sense be said to sink
with their subject, because though sound
in their treatment of it, they are not <i>poetical</i>,
poetical in the true, not the false sense of
the word; because, in fact, they are not
in the grand style. Homer can in no sense
be said to sink with his subject, because
his soundness has something more than
literal naturalness about it; because his
soundness is the soundness of Homer, of
a great epic poet; because, in fact, he is
in the grand style. So he sheds over the
simplest matter he touches the charm of his
grand manner; he makes everything noble.
Nothing has raised more questioning among
my critics than these words, <i>noble</i>, <i>the grand
style</i>. People complain that I do not define
these words sufficiently, that I do not tell
them enough about them. ‘The grand
style, but what <i>is</i> the grand style’? they
cry; some with an inclination to believe
in it, but puzzled; others mockingly and
with incredulity. Alas! the grand style
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>is the last matter in the world for verbal
definition to deal with adequately. One
may say of it as is said of faith: ‘One must
feel it in order to know what it is’. But,
as of faith, so too one may say of nobleness,
of the grand style: ‘Woe to those who
know it not’! Yet this expression, though
indefinable, has a charm; one is the better
for considering it; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>bonum est, nos hic esse</i></span>;
nay, one loves to try to explain it, though
one knows that one must speak imperfectly.
For those, then, who ask the question,
What is the grand style? with sincerity,
I will try to make some answer, inadequate
as it must be. For those who ask it mockingly
I have no answer, except to repeat
to them, with compassionate sorrow, the
Gospel words: <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Moriemini in peccatis vestris</i></span>,
Ye shall die in your sins.</p>

<p class='c005'>But let me, at any rate, have the pleasure
of again giving, before I begin to try and
define the grand style, a specimen of what
it <i>is</i>.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Standing on earth, not wrapt above the pole,</div>
      <div class='line'>More safe I sing with mortal voice, unchanged</div>
      <div class='line'>To hoarse or mute, though fall’n on evil days,</div>
      <div class='line'>On evil days though fall’n, and evil tongues....</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>There is the grand style in perfection; and
anyone who has a sense for it, will feel it
a thousand times better from repeating
those lines than from hearing anything I
can say about it.</p>

<p class='c005'>Let us try, however, what <i>can</i> be said,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>controlling what we say by examples. I think
it will be found that the grand style arises
in poetry, <i>when a noble nature, poetically
gifted, treats with simplicity or with severity a
serious subject</i>. I think this definition will be
found to cover all instances of the grand style
in poetry which present themselves. I think
it will be found to exclude all poetry which
is not in the grand style. And I think it
contains no terms which are obscure, which
themselves need defining. Even those who
do not understand what is meant by calling
poetry noble, will understand, I imagine,
what is meant by speaking of a noble nature
in a man. But the noble or powerful
nature—the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>bedeutendes Individuum</i></span> of
Goethe—is not enough. For instance, Mr
Newman has zeal for learning, zeal for thinking,
zeal for liberty, and all these things are
noble, they ennoble a man; but he has not
the poetical gift: there must be the poetical
gift, the ‘divine faculty’, also. And, besides
all this, the subject must be a serious
one (for it is only by a kind of licence that
we can speak of the grand style in comedy);
and it must be treated <i>with simplicity or
severity</i>. Here is the great difficulty: the
poets of the world have been many; there
has been wanting neither abundance of
poetical gift nor abundance of noble natures;
but a poetical gift so happy, in a noble
nature so circumstanced and trained, that
the result is a continuous style, perfect in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>simplicity or perfect in severity, has been
extremely rare. One poet has had the gifts
of nature and faculty in unequalled fulness,
without the circumstances and training
which make this sustained perfection of
style possible. Of other poets, some have
caught this perfect strain now and then,
in short pieces or single lines, but have not
been able to maintain it through considerable
works; others have composed all
their productions in a style which, by
comparison with the best, one must call
secondary.</p>

<p class='c005'>The best model of the grand style simple
is Homer; perhaps the best model of the
grand style severe is Milton. But Dante is
remarkable for affording admirable examples
of both styles; he has the grand style
which arises from simplicity, and he has
the grand style which arises from severity;
and from him I will illustrate them both.
In a former lecture I pointed out what that
severity of poetical style is, which comes
from saying a thing with a kind of intense
compression, or in an illusive, brief, almost
haughty way, as if the poet’s mind were
charged with so many and such grave
matters, that he would not deign to treat
any one of them explicitly. Of this severity
the last line of the following stanza of the
<i>Purgatory</i> is a good example. Dante has
been telling Forese that Virgil had guided
him through Hell, and he goes on:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Indi m’ han tratto su gli suoi conforti,</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Salendo e rigirando la Montagna</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>Che drizza voi che il mondo fece torti</i></span><a id='r59' /><a href='#f59' class='c009'><sup>[59]</sup></a>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>‘Thence hath his comforting aid led me up,
climbing and circling the Mountain, <i>which
straightens you whom the world made crooked</i>’.
These last words, <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">‘la Montagna <i>che drizza voi
che il mondo fece torti</i>’</span>, ‘the Mountain <i>which
straightens you whom the world made crooked</i>’,
for the Mountain of Purgatory, I call an excellent
specimen of the grand style in
severity, where the poet’s mind is too full
charged to suffer him to speak more explicitly.
But the very next stanza is a
beautiful specimen of the grand style in
simplicity, where a noble nature and a
poetical gift unite to utter a thing with the
most limpid plainness and clearness:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Tanto dice di farmi sua compagna</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Ch’ io sarὸ là dove fia Beatrice;</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Quivi convien che senza lui rimagna</span><a id='r60' /><a href='#f60' class='c009'><sup>[60]</sup></a>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>‘So long’, Dante continues, ‘so long he
(Virgil) saith he will bear me company,
until I shall be there where Beatrice is;
there it behoves that without him I remain’.
But the noble simplicity of that
in the Italian no words of mine can render.</p>

<p class='c005'>Both these styles, the simple and the
severe, are truly grand; the severe seems,
perhaps, the grandest, so long as we attend
most to the great personality, to the noble
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>nature, in the poet its author; the simple
seems the grandest when we attend most
to the exquisite faculty, to the poetical gift.
But the simple is no doubt to be preferred.
It is the more <i>magical</i>: in the other there
is something intellectual, something which
gives scope for a play of thought which may
exist where the poetical gift is either wanting
or present in only inferior degree: the
severe is much more imitable, and this a
little spoils its charm. A kind of semblance
of this style keeps Young going, one
may say, through all the nine parts of that
most indifferent production, the <i>Night
Thoughts</i>. But the grand style in simplicity
is inimitable:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in12'><span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αἰὼν ἀσφαλὴς</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">οὐκ ἔγεντ’ οὔτ’ Αἰακίδᾳ παρὰ Πηλεῖ,</span></div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>There is a limpidness in that, a want of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>salient points to seize and transfer, which
makes imitation impossible, except by a
genius akin to the genius which produced it.</p>

<p class='c005'>Greek simplicity and Greek grace are inimitable;
but it is said that the <i>Iliad</i> may
still be ballad-poetry while infinitely superior
to all other ballads, and that, in my specimens
of English ballad-poetry, I have been
unfair. Well, no doubt there are better
things in English ballad-poetry than</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Now Christ thee save, thou proud portér, ...</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>but the real strength of a chain, they say,
is the strength of its weakest link; and
what I was trying to show you was, that the
English ballad-style is not an instrument
of enough compass and force to correspond
to the Greek hexameter; that, owing to an
inherent weakness in it as an epic style,
it easily runs into one or two faults, either
it is prosaic and humdrum, or, trying to
avoid that fault, and to make itself lively
(<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>se faire vif</i></span>), it becomes pert and jaunty.
To show that, the passage about King
Adland’s porter serves very well. But these
degradations are not proper to a true epic
instrument, such as the Greek hexameter.</p>

<p class='c005'>You may say, if you like, when you find
Homer’s verse, even in describing the
plainest matter, neither humdrum nor
jaunty, that this is because he is so incomparably
better a poet than other balladists,
because he is Homer. But take the whole
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>range of Greek epic poetry, take the later
poets, the poets of the last ages of this
poetry, many of them most indifferent,
Coluthus, Tryphiodorus, Quintus of Smyrna,
Nonnus. Never will you find in this instrument
of the hexameter, even in their
hands, the vices of the ballad-style in the
weak moments of this last: everywhere the
hexameter, a noble, a truly epical instrument,
rather resists the weakness of its employer
than lends itself to it. Quintus of Smyrna
is a poet of merit, but certainly not a poet
of a high order: with him, too, epic poetry,
whether in the character of its prosody or
in that of its diction, is no longer the epic
poetry of earlier and better times, nor epic
poetry as again restored by Nonnus: but
even in Quintus of Smyrna, I say, the hexameter
is still the hexameter; it is a style
which the ballad-style, even in the hands
of better poets, cannot rival. And in the
hands of inferior poets, the ballad-style
sinks to vices of which the hexameter, even
in the hands of a Tryphiodorus, never can
become guilty.</p>

<p class='c005'>But a critic, whom it is impossible to read
without pleasure, and the disguise of whose
initials I am sure I may be allowed to penetrate,
Mr Spedding says that he ‘denies
altogether that the metrical movement of
the English hexameter has any resemblance
to that of the Greek’. Of course, in that
case, if the two metres in no respect correspond,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>praise accorded to the Greek hexameter
as an epical instrument will not extend
to the English. Mr Spedding seeks to
establish his proposition by pointing out
that the system of accentuation differs in
the English and in the Virgilian hexameter;
that in the first, the accent and the long
syllable (or what has to do duty as such)
coincide, in the second they do not. He
says that we cannot be so sure of the accent
with which Greek verse should be read as
of that with which Latin should; but that
the lines of Homer in which the accent and
the long syllable coincide, as in the English
hexameter, are certainly very rare. He
suggests a type of English hexameter in
agreement with the Virgilian model, and
formed on the supposition that ‘quantity
is as distinguishable in English as in Latin
or Greek by any ear that will attend to it’.
Of the truth of this supposition he entertains
no doubt. The new hexameter will, Mr
Spedding thinks, at least have the merit
of resembling, in its metrical movement,
the classical hexameter, which merit the
ordinary English hexameter has not. But
even with this improved hexameter he is not
satisfied; and he goes on, first to suggest
other metres for rendering Homer, and
finally to suggest that rendering Homer is
impossible.</p>

<p class='c005'>A scholar to whom all who admire Lucretius
owe a large debt of gratitude, Mr
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>Munro, has replied to Mr Spedding. Mr
Munro declares that ‘the accent of the old
Greeks and Romans resembled our accent
only in name, in reality was essentially
different’; that ‘our English reading of
Homer and Virgil has in itself no meaning’;
and that ‘accent has nothing to do with
the Virgilian hexameter’. If this be so,
of course the merit which Mr Spedding attributes
to his own hexameter, of really
corresponding with the Virgilian hexameter,
has no existence. Again; in contradiction
to Mr Spedding’s assertion that
lines in which (in our reading of them) the
accent and the long syllable coincide<a id='r62' /><a href='#f62' class='c009'><sup>[62]</sup></a>, as
in the ordinary English hexameter, are ‘rare
even in Homer’, Mr Munro declares that
such lines, ‘instead of being rare, are among
the very commonest types of Homeric
rhythm’. Mr Spedding asserts that ‘quantity
is as distinguishable in English as in
Latin or Greek by any ear that will attend
to it’; but Mr Munro replies, that in English
‘neither his ear nor his reason recognises any
real distinction of quantity except that
which is produced by accentuated and unaccentuated
syllables’. He therefore arrives
at the conclusion that in constructing
English hexameters, ‘quantity must be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>utterly discarded; and longer or shorter
unaccentuated syllables can have no meaning,
except so far as they may be made to
produce sweeter or harsher sounds in the
hands of a master’.</p>

<p class='c005'>It is not for me to interpose between two
such combatants; and indeed my way lies,
not up the highroad where they are contending,
but along a bypath. With the
absolute truth of their general propositions
respecting accent and quantity, I have
nothing to do; it is most interesting and
instructive to me to hear such propositions
discussed, when it is Mr Munro or Mr
Spedding who discusses them; but I have
strictly limited myself in these Lectures to
the humble function of giving practical advice
to the translator of Homer. He, I
still think, must not follow so confidently,
as makers of English hexameters have
hitherto followed, Mr Munro’s maxim,
<i>quantity may be utterly discarded</i>. He must
not, like Mr Longfellow, make <i>seventeen</i> a
dactyl in spite of all the length of its last
syllable, even though he can plead that in
counting we lay the accent on the first
syllable of this word. He may be far from
attaining Mr Spedding’s nicety of ear; may
be unable to feel that ‘while <i>quantity</i> is a
dactyl, <i>quiddity</i> is a tribrach’, and that
‘<i>rapidly</i> is a word to which we find no
parallel in Latin’; but I think he must
bring himself to distinguish, with Mr Spedding,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>between ‘<i>th’ o’er</i>-wearied eyelid’, and
‘<i>the</i> wearied eyelid’, as being, the one a
correct ending for a hexameter, the other
an ending with a false quantity in it; instead
of finding, with Mr Munro, that this
distinction ‘conveys to his mind no intelligible
idea’. He must temper his belief
in Mr Munro’s dictum, <i>quantity must be
utterly discarded</i>, by mixing with it a belief
in this other dictum of the same author,
<i>two or more consonants take longer time in
enunciating than one</i><a id='r63' /><a href='#f63' class='c009'><sup>[63]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c005'>Criticism is so apt in general to be vague
and impalpable, that when it gives us a
solid and definite possession, such as is Mr
Spedding’s parallel of the Virgilian and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>English hexameter with their difference of
accentuation distinctly marked, we cannot
be too grateful to it. It is in the way in
which Mr Spedding proceeds to press his
conclusions from the parallel which he has
drawn out, that his criticism seems to me
to come a little short. Here even he, I
think, shows (if he will allow me to say so)
a little of that want of pliancy and suppleness
so common among critics, but so
dangerous to their criticism; he is a little
too absolute in imposing his metrical laws;
he too much forgets the excellent maxim
of Menander, so applicable to literary criticism:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Καλὸν οἱ νόμοι σφόδρ’ εἰσίν· ὁ δ’ ὁρῶν τοὺς νόμους</span></div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>‘Laws are admirable things; but he who
keeps his eye too closely fixed upon them,
runs the risk of becoming’, let us say, a
purist. Mr Spedding is probably mistaken
in supposing that Virgil pronounced his
hexameters as Mr Spedding pronounces
them. He is almost certainly mistaken in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>supposing that Homer pronounced his hexameters
as Mr Spedding pronounces Virgil’s.
But this, as I have said, is not a question
for us to treat; all we are here concerned
with is the imitation, by the English hexameter,
of the ancient hexameter <i>in its effect
upon us moderns</i>. Suppose we concede to
Mr Spedding that his parallel proves our
accentuation of the English and of the
Virgilian hexameter to be different: what
are we to conclude from that; how will a
criticism, not a formal, but a substantial
criticism, deal with such a fact as that?
Will it infer, as Mr Spedding infers, that the
English hexameter, therefore, must not pretend
to reproduce better than other rhythms
the movement of Homer’s hexameter for
us, that there can be no correspondence at
all between the movement of these two hexameters,
that if we want to have such a correspondence,
we must abandon the current
English hexameter altogether, and adopt in
its place a new hexameter of Mr Spedding’s
Anglo-Latin type, substitute for lines like
the</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>

      <div class='line'>Clearly the rest I behold of the dark-eyed sons of Achaia ...</div>

      <div class='line'>Procession, complex melodies, pause, quantity, accent,</div>
      <div class='line'>After Virgilian precedent and practice, in order ...</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>of Mr Spedding? To infer this, is to go,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>as I have complained of Mr Newman for
sometimes going, a great deal too fast. I
think prudent criticism must certainly recognise,
in the current English hexameter,
a fact which cannot so lightly be set aside;
it must acknowledge that by this hexameter
the English ear, the genius of the English
language, have, in their own way, adopted,
have <i>translated</i> for themselves the Homeric
hexameter; and that a rhythm which has
thus grown up, which is thus, in a manner,
the production of nature, has in its general
type something necessary and inevitable,
something which admits change only within
narrow limits, which precludes change that
is sweeping and essential. I think, therefore,
the prudent critic will regard Mr
Spedding’s proposed revolution as simply
impracticable. He will feel that in English
poetry the hexameter, if used at all, must
be, in the main, the English hexameter now
current. He will perceive that its having
come into existence as the representative
of the Homeric hexameter, proves it to
have, for the English ear, a certain correspondence
with the Homeric hexameter,
although this correspondence may be, from
the difference of the Greek and English
languages, necessarily incomplete. This
incompleteness he will endeavour<a id='r64' /><a href='#f64' class='c009'><sup>[64]</sup></a>, as he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>may find or fancy himself able, gradually
somewhat to lessen through minor changes,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>suggested by the ancient hexameter, but
respecting the general constitution of the
modern: the notion of making it disappear
altogether by the critic’s inventing in his
closet a new constitution of his own for the
English hexameter, he will judge to be a
chimerical dream.</p>

<p class='c005'>When, therefore, Mr Spedding objects to
the English hexameter, that it imperfectly
represents the movement of the ancient
hexameters, I answer: We must work with
the tools we have. The received English
type, in its general outlines, is, for England,
the necessary given type of this metre; it
is by rendering the metrical beat of its
pattern, not by rendering the accentual
beat of it, that the English language has
adapted the Greek hexameter. To render
the metrical beat of its pattern is something;
by effecting so much as this the
English hexameter puts itself in closer relations
with its original, it comes nearer to
its movement than any other metre which
does not even effect so much as this; but
Mr Spedding is dissatisfied with it for not
effecting more still, for not rendering the
accentual beat too. If he asks me <i>why</i> the
English hexameter has not tried to render
this too, <i>why</i> it has confined itself to rendering
the metrical beat, <i>why</i>, in short, it is
itself, and not Mr Spedding’s new hexameter,
that is a question which I, whose only business
is to give practical advice to a translator,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>am not bound to answer; but I will
not decline to answer it nevertheless. I will
suggest to Mr Spedding that, as I have already
said, the modern hexameter is merely
an attempt to imitate the effect of the
ancient hexameter, as read by us moderns;
that the great object of its imitation has
been the hexameter of Homer; that of this
hexameter such lines as those which Mr
Spedding declares to be so rare, even in
Homer, but which are in truth so common,
lines in which the quantity and the reader’s
accent coincide, are, for the English reader,
just from that simplicity (for him) of rhythm
which they owe to this very coincidence, the
master-type; that so much is this the case
that one may again and again notice an
English reader of Homer, in reading lines
where his Virgilian accent would not coincide
with the quantity, abandoning this
accent, and reading the lines (as we say)
<i>by quantity</i>, reading them as if he were
scanning them; while foreigners neglect
our Virgilian accent even in reading Virgil,
read even Virgil by quantity, making the
accents coincide with the long syllables.
And no doubt the hexameter of a kindred
language, the German, based on this mode
of reading the ancient hexameter, has had
a powerful influence upon the type of its
English fellow. But all this shows how
extremely powerful accent is for us moderns,
since we find not even Greek and Latin
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>quantity perceptible enough without it. Yet
in these languages, where we have been accustomed
always to look for it, it is far
more perceptible to us Englishmen than in
our own language, where we have not been
accustomed to look for it. And here is the
true reason why Mr Spedding’s hexameter
is not and cannot be the current English
hexameter, even though it is based on the
accentuation which Englishmen give to all
Virgil’s lines, and to many of Homer’s,—that
the quantity which in Greek or Latin
words we feel, or imagine we feel, even
though it be unsupported by accent, we do
not feel or imagine we feel in English words
when it is thus unsupported. For example,
in repeating the Latin line</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ipsa tibi blandos <i>fundent</i> cunabula flores,</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>an Englishman feels the length of the second
syllable of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>fundent</i></span>, although he lays the
accent on the first; but in repeating Mr
Spedding’s line,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Softly cometh slumber <i>closing</i> th’ o’erwearied eyelid,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>the English ear, full of the accent on the first
syllable of <i>closing</i>, has really no sense at all
of any length in its second. The metrical
beat of the line is thus quite destroyed.</p>

<p class='c005'>So when Mr Spedding proposes a new
Anglo-Virgilian hexameter he proposes an
impossibility; when he ‘denies altogether
that the metrical movement of the English
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>hexameter has <i>any</i> resemblance to that of
the Greek’, he denies too much; when he
declares that, ‘were every other metre impossible,
an attempt to translate Homer
into English hexameters might be permitted,
<i>but that such an attempt he himself would
never read</i>’, he exhibits, it seems to me, a
little of that obduracy and over-vehemence
in liking and disliking,—a remnant, I suppose,
of our insular ferocity,—to which
English criticism is so prone. He ought
to be enchanted to meet with a good attempt
in any metre, even though he would never
have advised it, even though its success
be contrary to all his expectations; for it
is the critic’s first duty—prior even to his
duty of stigmatizing what is bad—<i>to welcome
everything that is good</i>. In welcoming
this, he must at all times be ready, like the
Christian convert, even to burn what he
used to worship, and to worship what he
used to burn. Nay, but he need not be
thus inconsistent in welcoming it; he may
retain all his principles: principles endure,
circumstances change; absolute success is
one thing, relative success another. Relative
success may take place under the
most diverse conditions; and it is in appreciating
the good in even relative success,
it is in taking into account the change of
circumstances, that the critic’s judgment is
tested, that his versatility must display
itself. He is to keep his idea of the best,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>of perfection, and at the same time to be
willingly accessible to every second best
which offers itself. So I enjoy the ease
and beauty of Mr Spedding’s stanza,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Therewith to all the gods in order due ...</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>I welcome it, in the absence of equally good
poetry in another metre<a id='r65' /><a href='#f65' class='c009'><sup>[65]</sup></a>, although I still
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>think the stanza unfit to render Homer
thoroughly well, although I still think other
metres fit to render him better. So I concede
to Mr Spedding that every form of
translation, prose or verse, must more or
less break up Homer in order to reproduce
him; but then I urge that that form which
needs to break him up least is to be preferred.
So I concede to him that the test proposed
by me for the translator—a competent
scholar’s judgment whether the translation
more or less reproduces for him the effect
of the original—is not perfectly satisfactory;
but I adopt it as the best we can get, as the
only test capable of being really applied;
for Mr Spedding’s proposed substitute, the
translations making the same effect, more
or less, upon the unlearned which the original
makes upon the scholar, is a test which
can never really be applied at all. These
two impressions, that of the scholar, and
that of the unlearned reader, can, practically,
never be accurately compared; they are,
and must remain, like those lines we read
of in Euclid, which, though produced ever
so far, can never meet. So, again, I concede
that a good verse-translation of Homer, or,
indeed, of any poet, is very difficult, and
that a good prose-translation is much easier;
but then I urge that a verse-translation,
while giving the pleasure which Pope’s has
given, might at the same time render Homer
more faithfully than Pope’s; and that this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>being possible, we ought not to cease wishing
for a source of pleasure which no prose-translation
can ever hope to rival.</p>

<p class='c005'>Wishing for such a verse-translation of
Homer, believing that rhythms have natural
tendencies which, within certain limits, inevitably
govern them; having little faith,
therefore, that rhythms which have manifested
tendencies utterly un-Homeric can
so change themselves as to become well
adapted for rendering Homer, I have looked
about for the rhythm which seems to depart
least from the tendencies of Homer’s
rhythm. Such a rhythm I think may be
found in the English hexameter, somewhat
modified. I look with hope towards continued
attempts at perfecting and employing
this rhythm; but my belief in the immediate
success of such attempts is far less confident
than has been supposed. Between the recognition
of this rhythm as ideally the best,
and the recommendation of it to the translator
for instant practical use, there must
come all that consideration of circumstances,
all that pliancy in foregoing, under the pressure
of certain difficulties, the absolute best,
which I have said is so indispensable to the
critic. The hexameter is, comparatively,
still unfamiliar in England; many people
have a great dislike to it. A certain degree
of unfamiliarity, a certain degree of dislike,
are obstacles with which it is not wise to
contend. It is difficult to say at present
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>whether the dislike to this rhythm is so
strong and so wide-spread that it will prevent
its ever becoming thoroughly familiar.
I think not, but it is too soon to decide.
I am inclined to think that the dislike of
it is rather among the professional critics
than among the general public; I think the
reception which Mr Longfellow’s <i>Evangeline</i>
has met with indicates this. I think that
even now, if a version of the <i>Iliad</i> in English
hexameters were made by a poet who, like
Mr Longfellow, has that indefinable quality
which renders him popular, something <i>attractive</i>
in his talent, which communicates
itself to his verses, it would have a great
success among the general public. Yet a
version of Homer in hexameters of the
<i>Evangeline</i> type would not satisfy the judicious,
nor is the definite establishment of this
type to be desired; and one would regret
that Mr Longfellow should, even to popularise
the hexameter, give the immense
labour required for a translation of Homer
when one could not wish his work to stand.
Rather it is to be wished that by the efforts
of poets like Mr Longfellow in original
poetry, and the efforts of less distinguished
poets in the task of translation, the hexameter
may gradually be made familiar to
the ear of the English public; at the same
time that there gradually arises, out of all
these efforts, an improved type of this
rhythm; a type which some man of genius
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>may sign with the final stamp, and employ
in rendering Homer; a hexameter which
may be as superior to Vosse’s as Shakspeare’s
blank verse is superior to Schiller’s. I am
inclined to believe that all this travail will
actually take place, because I believe that
modern poetry is actually in want of such
an instrument as the hexameter.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the meantime, whether this rhythm
be destined to success or not, let us steadily
keep in mind what originally made us turn
to it. We turned to it because we required
certain Homeric characteristics in a translation
of Homer, and because all other
rhythms seemed to find, from different
causes, great difficulties in satisfying this
our requirement. If the hexameter is impossible,
if one of these other rhythms must
be used, let us keep this rhythm always in
mind of our requirements and of its own
faults, let us compel it to get rid of these
latter as much as possible. It may be
necessary to have recourse to blank verse;
but then blank verse must <i>de-Cowperize</i>
itself, must get rid of the habits of stiff
self-retardation which make it say ‘<i>Not
fewer</i> shone’, for ‘<i>So many shone</i>’. Homer
moves swiftly: blank verse <i>can</i> move
swiftly if it likes, but it must remember
that the movement of such lines as</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>A thousand fires were burning, and by each ...</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>is just the slow movement which makes us
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>despair of it. Homer moves with noble
ease: blank verse must not be suffered to
forget that the movement of</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Came they not over from sweet Lacedæmon ...</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>is ungainly. Homer’s expression of his
thought is simple as light: we know how
blank verse affects such locutions as</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>While the steeds <i>mouthed their corn aloof</i> ...</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>and such models of expressing one’s thought
are sophisticated and artificial.</p>

<p class='c005'>One sees how needful it is to direct incessantly
the English translator’s attention
to the essential characteristics of Homer’s
poetry, when so accomplished a person as
Mr Spedding, recognising these characteristics
as indeed Homer’s, admitting them to
be essential, is led by the ingrained habits
and tendencies of English blank verse thus
repeatedly to lose sight of them in translating
even a few lines. One sees this yet
more clearly, when Mr Spedding, taking
me to task for saying that the blank verse
used for rendering Homer ‘must not be
Mr Tennyson’s blank verse’, declares that
in most of Mr Tennyson’s blank verse all
Homer’s essential characteristics, ‘rapidity
of movement, <i>plainness of words and style</i>,
<i>simplicity and directness of ideas</i>, and, above
all, nobleness of manner, are as conspicuous
as in Homer himself’. This shows, it seems
to me, how hard it is for English readers
of poetry, even the most accomplished, to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>feel deeply and permanently what Greek
plainness of thought and Greek simplicity
of expression really are: they admit the
importance of these qualities in a general
way, but they have no ever-present sense
of them; and they easily attribute them
to any poetry which has other excellent
qualities, and which they very much admire.
No doubt there are plainer things in Mr
Tennyson’s poetry than the three lines I
quoted; in choosing them, as in choosing
a specimen of ballad-poetry, I wished to
bring out clearly, by a strong instance, the
qualities of thought and style to which I
was calling attention; but when Mr Spedding
talks of a plainness of thought <i>like
Homer’s</i>, of a plainness of speech <i>like
Homer’s</i>, and says that he finds these constantly
in Mr Tennyson’s poetry, I answer
that these I do not find there at all. Mr
Tennyson is a most distinguished and
charming poet; but the very essential
characteristic of his poetry is, it seems to
me, an extreme subtlety and curious elaborateness
of thought, an extreme subtlety
and curious elaborateness of expression. In
the best and most characteristic productions
of his genius, these characteristics are most
prominent. They are marked characteristics,
as we have seen, of the Elizabethan
poets; they are marked, though not the
essential, characteristics of Shakspeare himself.
Under the influences of the nineteenth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>century, under wholly new conditions of
thought and culture, they manifest themselves
in Mr Tennyson’s poetry in a wholly
new way. But they are still there. The
essential bent of his poetry is towards such
expressions as</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>

</div>

<p class='c008'>And this way of speaking is the least <i>plain</i>,
the most <i>un-Homeric</i>, which can possibly
be conceived. Homer presents his thought
to you just as it wells from the source of
his mind: Mr Tennyson carefully distils his
thought before he will part with it. Hence
comes, in the expression of the thought, a
heightened and elaborate air. In Homer’s
poetry it is all natural thoughts in natural
words; in Mr Tennyson’s poetry it is all
distilled thoughts in distilled words. Exactly
this heightening and elaboration may
be observed in Mr Spedding’s</p>

Tennyson’s), on which I have already commented;

subtle sophistication of the thought is, I
think, very perceptible even in such lines

<p class='c008'>which I have seen quoted as perfectly
Homeric. Perfect simplicity can be obtained
only by a genius of which perfect
simplicity is an essential characteristic.</p>

<p class='c005'>So true is this, that when a genius essentially
subtle, or a genius which, from
whatever cause, is in its essence not truly
and broadly simple, determines to be perfectly
plain, determines not to admit a
shade of subtlety or curiosity into its expression,
it cannot ever then attain real
simplicity; it can only attain a semblance
of simplicity<a id='r66' /><a href='#f66' class='c009'><sup>[66]</sup></a>. French criticism, richer in
its vocabulary than ours, has invented a
useful word to distinguish this semblance
(often very beautiful and valuable) from
the real quality. The real quality it calls

      <div class='line'>Upon the forest-side in Grasmere Vale</div>
      <div class='line'>There dwelt a shepherd, Michael was his name;</div>
      <div class='line'>An old man, stout of heart, and strong of limb.</div>
      <div class='line'>His bodily frame had been from youth to age</div>
      <div class='line'>Of an unusual strength; his mind was keen,</div>
      <div class='line'>Intense, and frugal, apt for all affairs;</div>
      <div class='line'>And in his shepherd’s calling he was prompt</div>

<p class='c008'>Now let us take the opening of the narrative
in Mr Tennyson’s <i>Dora</i>:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>With Farmer Allan at the farm abode</div>
      <div class='line'>William and Dora. William was his son,</div>
      <div class='line'>And she his niece. He often looked at them,</div>
      <div class='line'>And often thought, ‘I’ll make them man and wife’.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The simplicity of the first of these passages
is <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>simplicité</i></span>; that of the second, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>simplesse</i></span>.
Let us take the end of the same two poems:
first, of <i>Michael</i>:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The cottage which was named the Evening Star</div>
      <div class='line'>Is gone, the ploughshare has been through the ground</div>
      <div class='line'>On which it stood; great changes have been wrought</div>
      <div class='line'>In all the neighbourhood: yet the oak is left</div>
      <div class='line'>That grew beside their door: and the remains</div>
      <div class='line'>Of the unfinished sheepfold may be seen</div>
      <div class='line'>Beside the boisterous brook of Green-head Ghyll.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>And now, of <i>Dora</i>:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in16'>So those four abode</div>
      <div class='line'>Within one house together; and as years</div>
      <div class='line'>Went forward, Mary took another mate:</div>
      <div class='line'>But Dora lived unmarried till her death.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>A heedless critic may call both of these
passages simple if he will. Simple, in a
certain sense, they both are; but between
the simplicity of the two there is all the
difference that there is between the simplicity
of Homer and the simplicity of Moschus.</p>

<p class='c005'>But, whether the hexameter establish itself
or not, whether a truly simple and rapid
blank verse be obtained or not, as the
vehicle for a standard English translation
of Homer, I feel sure that this vehicle will
not be furnished by the ballad-form. On
this question about the ballad-character of
Homer’s poetry, I see that Professor Blackie
proposes a compromise: he suggests that
those who say Homer’s poetry is pure ballad-poetry,
and those who deny that it is ballad-poetry
at all, should split the difference
between them; that it should be agreed
that Homer’s poems are ballads <i>a little</i>,
but not so much as some have said. I am
very sensible to the courtesy of the terms
in which Mr Blackie invites me to this
compromise; but I cannot, I am sorry to
say, accept it; I cannot allow that Homer’s
poetry is ballad-poetry at all. A want of
capacity for sustained nobleness seems to
me inherent in the ballad-form when employed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>for epic poetry. The more we examine
this proposition, the more certain,
I think, will it become to us. Let us but
observe how a great poet, having to deliver
a narrative very weighty and serious, instinctively
shrinks from the ballad-form as
from a form not commensurate with his
subject-matter, a form too narrow and
shallow for it, and seeks for a form which
has more amplitude and impressiveness.
Everyone knows the <i>Lucy Gray</i> and the
<i>Ruth</i> of Wordsworth. Both poems are excellent;
but the subject-matter of the
narrative of <i>Ruth</i> is much more weighty
and impressive to the poet’s own feeling
than that of the narrative of <i>Lucy Gray</i>,
for which latter, in its unpretending simplicity,
the ballad-form is quite adequate.
Wordsworth, at the time he composed <i>Ruth</i>,
his great time, his <i>annus mirabilis</i>, about
1800, strove to be simple; it was his mission
to be simple; he loved the ballad-form, he
clung to it, because it was simple. Even
in <i>Ruth</i> he tried, one may say, to use it;
he would have used it if he could: but
the gravity of his matter is too much for
this somewhat slight form; he is obliged
to give to his form more amplitude, more
augustness, to shake out its folds.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The wretched parents all that night</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Went shouting far and wide;</div>
      <div class='line'>But there was neither sound nor sight</div>
      <div class='line in2'>To serve them for a guide.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>That is beautiful, no doubt, and the form
is adequate to the subject-matter. But take
this, on the other hand:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>I, too, have passed her on the hills,</div>
      <div class='line'>Setting her little water-mills</div>
      <div class='line in2'>By spouts and fountains wild;</div>
      <div class='line'>Such small machinery as she turned,</div>
      <div class='line'>Ere she had wept, ere she had mourned,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>A young and happy child.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Who does not perceive how the greater
fulness and weight of his matter has here
compelled the true and feeling poet to adopt
a form of more <i>volume</i> than the simple
ballad-form?</p>

<p class='c005'>It is of narrative poetry that I am speaking;
the question is about the use of the ballad-form
for <i>this</i>. I say that for this poetry
(when in the grand style, as Homer’s is)
the ballad-form is entirely inadequate; and
that Homer’s translator must not adopt it,
because it even leads him, by its own weakness,
away from the grand style rather than
towards it. We must remember that the
matter of narrative poetry stands in a
different relation to the vehicle which conveys
it, is not so independent of this vehicle,
so absorbing and powerful in itself, as the
matter of purely emotional poetry. When
there comes in poetry what I may call the
<i>lyrical cry</i>, this transfigures everything,
makes everything grand; the simplest
form may be here even an advantage, because
the flame of the emotion glows through
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>and through it more easily. To go again
for an illustration to Wordsworth; our
great poet, since Milton, by his performance,
as Keats, I think, is our great poet by his
gift and promise; in one of his stanzas
to the Cuckoo, we have:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>And I can listen to thee yet;</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Can lie upon the plain</div>
      <div class='line'>And listen, till I do beget</div>
      <div class='line in2'>That golden time again.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Here the lyrical cry, though taking the
simple ballad-form, is as grand as the lyrical
cry coming in poetry of an ampler form,
as grand as the</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>An innocent life, yet far astray!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>of <i>Ruth</i>; as the</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>There is a comfort in the strength of love</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>of <i>Michael</i>. In this way, by the occurrence
of this lyrical cry, the ballad-poets themselves
rise sometimes, though not so often
as one might perhaps have hoped, to the
grand style.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>O lang, lang may their ladies sit,</div>
      <div class='line'>Wi’ their fans into their hand,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or ere they see Sir Patrick Spence</div>
      <div class='line'>Come sailing to the land.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>O lang, lang may the ladies stand,</div>
      <div class='line'>Wi’ their gold combs in their hair,</div>
      <div class='line'>Waiting for their ain dear lords,</div>
      <div class='line'>For they’ll see them nae mair.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>But from this impressiveness of the ballad-form,
when its subject-matter fills it over
and over again, is, indeed, in itself, all in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>all, one must not infer its effectiveness when
its subject-matter is not thus overpowering,
in the great body of a narrative.</p>

<p class='c005'>But, after all, Homer is not a better poet
than the balladists, because he has taken
in the hexameter a better instrument; he
took this instrument because he was a
<i>different</i> poet from them; so different, not
only so much better, but so essentially
different, that he has not to be classed
with them at all. Poets receive their distinctive
character, not from their subject,
but from their application to that subject
of the ideas (to quote the <i>Excursion</i>)</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>On God, on Nature, and on human life,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>which they have acquired for themselves.
In the ballad-poets in general, as in men
of a rude and early stage of the world, in
whom their humanity is not yet variously
and fully developed, the stock of these ideas
is scanty, and the ideas themselves not very
effective or profound. From them the narrative
itself is the great matter, not the
spirit and significance which underlies the
narrative. Even in later times of richly
developed life and thought, poets appear
who have what may be called a <i>balladist’s
mind</i>; in whom a fresh and lively curiosity
for the outward spectacle of the world is
much more strong than their sense of the
inward significance of that spectacle. When
they apply ideas to their narrative of human
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>events, you feel that they are, so to speak,
travelling out of their own province: in
the best of them you feel this perceptibly,
but in those of a lower order you feel it very
strongly. Even Sir Walter Scott’s efforts
of this kind, even, for instance, the</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Breathes there the man with soul so dead,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>or the</p>

  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>O woman! in our hours of ease,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>even these leave, I think, as high poetry,
much to be desired; far more than the same
poet’s descriptions of a hunt or a battle.
But Lord Macaulay’s</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Then out spake brave Horatius,</div>

      <div class='line in2'>Death cometh soon or late’.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>(and here, since I have been reproached
with undervaluing Lord Macaulay’s <i>Lays
of Ancient Rome</i>, let me frankly say that,
to my mind, a man’s power to detect the
ring of false metal in those Lays is a good
measure of his fitness to give an opinion
about poetical matters at all), I say, Lord
Macaulay’s</p>

<p class='c008'>it is hard to read without a cry of pain.
But with Homer it is very different. This
‘noble barbarian’, this ‘savage with the
lively eye’, whose verse, Mr Newman thinks,
would affect us, if we could hear the living
Homer, ‘like an elegant and simple melody
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>from an African of the Gold Coast’, is never
more at home, never more nobly himself,
than in applying profound ideas to his
narrative. As a poet he belongs, narrative
as is his poetry, and early as is his date,
to an incomparably more developed spiritual
and intellectual order than the balladists,
or than Scott and Macaulay; he is here as
much to be distinguished from them, and
in the same way, as Milton is to be distinguished
from them. He is, indeed, rather
to be classed with Milton than with the
balladists and Scott; for what he has in
common with Milton, the noble and profound
application of ideas to life is the most
essential part of poetic greatness. The most
essentially grand and characteristic things
of Homer are such things as</p>

<p class='c005'>I suppose I must, before I conclude, say
a word or two about my own hexameters;

ashamed to trouble you. From those perishable
objects I feel, I can truly say, a most
Oriental detachment. You yourselves are
witnesses how little importance, when I
offered them to you, I claimed for them,
how humble a function I designed them
to fill. I offered them, not as specimens
of a competing translation of Homer, but as
illustrations of certain canons which I had
been trying to establish for Homer’s poetry.
I said that these canons they might very well
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>illustrate by failing as well as by succeeding:
if they illustrate them in any manner, I am
satisfied. I was thinking of the future
translator of Homer, and trying to let him
see as clearly as possible what I meant by
the combination of characteristics which I
assigned to Homer’s poetry, by saying that
this poetry was at once rapid in movement,
plain in words and style, simple and direct
in its ideas, and noble in manner. I do not
suppose that my own hexameters are rapid
in movement, plain in words and style,
simple and direct in their ideas, and noble
in manner; but I am in hopes that a translator,
reading them with a genuine interest
in his subject, and without the slightest
grain of personal feeling, may see more
clearly, as he reads them, what I meant by
saying that Homer’s poetry is all these.

<p class='c008'>At the same time there may be innumerable
points in mine which he ought to avoid also.
Of the merit of his own compositions no
composer can be admitted the judge.</p>

<p class='c005'>But thus humbly useful to the future
translator I still hope my hexameters may
prove; and he it is, above all, whom one
has to regard. The general public carries
away little from discussions of this kind,
except some vague notion that one advocates
English hexameters, or that one has
attacked Mr Newman. On the mind of an
adversary one never makes the faintest impression.
Mr Newman reads all one can
say about diction, and his last word on the
subject is, that he ‘regards it as a question
about to open hereafter, whether a translator
of Homer ought not to adopt the old
dissyllabic <i>landis</i>, <i>houndis</i>, <i>hartis</i>’ (for lands,
hounds, harts), and also ‘the final <i>en</i> of the
plural of verbs (we <i>dancen</i>, they <i>singen</i>, etc.),
which still subsists in Lancashire’. A certain
critic reads all one can say about style, and
at the end of it arrives at the inference that,
‘after all, there is some style grander than
the grand style itself, since Shakspeare has
not the grand manner, and yet has the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>supremacy over Milton’; another critic
reads all one can say about rhythm, and the
result is, that he thinks Scott’s rhythm, in
the description of the death of Marmion,
all the better for being <i>saccadé</i>, because the
dying ejaculations of Marmion were likely
to be ‘jerky’. How vain to rise up early,
and to take rest late, from any zeal for
proving to Mr Newman that he must not,
in translating Homer, say <i>houndis</i> and
<i>dancen</i>; or to the first of the two critics
above quoted, that one poet may be a greater
poetical force than another, and yet have a
more unequal style; or to the second, that
the best art, having to represent the death
of a hero, does not set about imitating his
dying noises! Such critics, however, provide
for an opponent’s vivacity the charming
excuse offered by Rivarol for his, when he
was reproached with giving offence by it:
‘Ah’! he exclaimed, ‘no one considers
how much pain every man of taste has had
to <i>suffer</i>, before he ever inflicts any’.</p>

<p class='c005'>It is for the future translator that one
must work. The successful translator of
Homer will have (or he cannot succeed)
that true sense for his subject, and that disinterested
love for it, which are, both of
them, so rare in literature, and so precious;
he will not be led off by any false scent;
he will have an eye for the real matter, and
where he thinks he may find any indication
of this, no hint will be too slight for him,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>no shade will be too fine, no imperfections
will turn him aside, he will go before his
adviser’s thought, and help it out with his
own. This is the sort of student that a
critic of Homer should always have in his
thoughts; but students of this sort are
indeed rare.</p>

<p class='c005'>And how, then, can I help being reminded
what a student of this sort we have just lost
in Mr Clough, whose name I have already
mentioned in these lectures? He, too, was
busy with Homer; but it is not on that
account that I now speak of him. Nor do
I speak of him in order to call attention to
his qualities and powers in general, admirable
as these were. I mention him because,
in so eminent a degree, he possessed
these two invaluable literary qualities, a true
sense for his object of study, and a single-hearted
care for it. He had both; but he
had the second even more eminently than
the first. He greatly developed the first
through means of the second. In the study
of art, poetry, or philosophy, he had the
most undivided and disinterested love for
his object in itself, the greatest aversion to
mixing up with it anything accidental or
personal. His interest was in literature
itself; and it was this which gave so rare
a stamp to his character, which kept him
so free from all taint of littleness. In the
saturnalia of ignoble personal passions, of
which the struggle for literary success, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>old and crowded communities, offers so sad
a spectacle, he never mingled. He had not
yet traduced his friends, nor flattered his
enemies, nor disparaged what he admired,
nor praised what he despised. Those who
knew him well had the conviction that, even
with time, these literary arts would never
be his. His poem, of which I before spoke,
has some admirable Homeric qualities;—out-of-doors
freshness, life, naturalness,
buoyant rapidity. Some of the expressions
in that poem, ‘<i>Dangerous Corrievreckan ...
Where roads are unknown to Loch Nevish</i>’,
come back now to my ear with the true
Homeric ring. But that in him of which
I think oftenest is the Homeric simplicity
of his literary life.</p>

<p class='c008'>I have changed Dr Hawtrey’s ‘Kastor’, ‘Lakedaimon’,
back to the familiar ‘Castor’, ‘Lacedæmon’,
in obedience to my own rule that everything <i>odd</i> is
to be avoided in rendering Homer, the most natural
and least odd of poets. I see Mr Newman’s critic in
the <i>National Review</i> urges our generation to bear
with the unnatural effect of these rewritten Greek
names, in the hope that by this means the effect of
them may have to the next generation become natural.
For my part, I feel no disposition to pass all my own
life in the wilderness of pedantry, in order that a
posterity which I shall never see may one day enter
an orthographical Canaan; and, after all, the real
question is this: whether our living apprehension of
the Greek world is more checked by meeting in an
English book about the Greeks, names not spelt letter
for letter as in the original Greek, or by meeting
names which make us rub our eyes and call out,
‘How exceedingly odd!’</p>

<p class='c005'>The Latin names of the Greek deities raise in most
cases the idea of quite distinct personages from the
personages whose idea is raised by the Greek names.
Hera and Juno are actually, to every scholar’s imagination,
two different people. So in all these cases the
Latin names must, at any inconvenience, be abandoned
when we are dealing with the Greek world.
But I think it can be in the sensitive imagination of
Mr Grote only, that ‘Thucydides’ raises the idea of
a different man from <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><b>Θουκυδίδης</b></span>.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f30'>
<p class='c005'><span class='label'><a href='#r30'>30</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>For instance; in a version (I believe, by the late
Mr Lockhart) of Homer’s description of the parting
of Hector and Andromache, there occurs, in the first
five lines, but one spondee besides the necessary
spondees in the sixth place; in the corresponding
five lines of Homer there occur ten. See <i>English
Hexameter Translations</i>, 244.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f31'>
<p class='c005'><span class='label'><a href='#r31'>31</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>See for instance, in the <i>Iliad</i>, the loose construction
of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><b>ὅστε</b></span>, <abbr title='17'>xvii.</abbr> 658; that of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><b>ἴδοιτο</b></span>, <abbr title='17'>xvii.</abbr> 681;
that of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><b>οἵτε</b></span>, <abbr title='18'>xviii.</abbr> 209; and the elliptical construction
at <abbr title='19'>xix.</abbr> 42, 43; also the idiomatic construction of
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><b>ἐγὼν ὅδε παρασχεῖν</b></span>, <abbr title='19'>xix.</abbr> 140. These instances are
all taken within a range of a thousand lines; anyone
may easily multiply them for himself.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f32'>
<p class='c005'><span class='label'><a href='#r32'>32</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Our knowledge of Homer’s Greek is hardly such
as to enable us to pronounce quite confidently what is
idiomatic in his diction, and what is not, any more
than in his grammar; but I seem to myself clearly
to recognise an idiomatic stamp in such expressions as
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><b>τολυπεύειν πολέμους</b></span>, <abbr title='14'>xiv.</abbr> 86; <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><b>φάος ἐν νήεσσιν θήῃς</b></span>,
<abbr title='16'>xvi.</abbr> 94; <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><b>τιν’ οἴω ἀσπασίως αὐτῶν γόνυ κάμψειν</b></span>, <abbr title='19'>xix.</abbr>
71; <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><b>κλοτοπεύειν</b></span>, <abbr title='19'>xix.</abbr> 149; and many others. The
first-quoted expression, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><b>τολυπεύειν ἀργαλέους πολέμους</b></span>,
seems to me to have just about the same degree
of freedom as the ‘<i>jump</i> the life to come’, or the
‘<i>shuffle off</i> this mortal coil’, of Shakspeare.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f33'>
<p class='c005'><span class='label'><a href='#r33'>33</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It must be remembered, however, that, if we
disregard quantity too much in constructing English
hexameters, we also disregard accent too much in
reading Greek hexameters. We read every Greek
dactyl so as to make a pure dactyl of it; but, to a
Greek, the accent must have hindered many dactyls
from sounding as pure dactyls. When we read
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><b>αἰόλος</b> ἵππος</span>, for instance, or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><b>αἰγιόχοιο</b></span>, the
dactyl in each of these cases is made by us as pure a
dactyl as ‘Tityre’, or ‘dignity’; but to a Greek it
was not so. To him <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αἰόλος</span> must have been nearly
as impure a dactyl as ‘death-destined’ is to us; and
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αἰγιόχ</span> nearly as impure as the ‘dressed his own’ of
my text. Nor, I think, does this right mode of
pronouncing the two words at all spoil the run of the
line as a hexameter. The effect of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><b>αἰόλλος</b> ἵππος</span>
(or something like that), though not <i>our</i> effect, is not
a disagreeable one. On the other hand, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κορυθαιόλος</span>
as a paroxytonon, although it has the respectable
authority of Liddell and Scott’s <i>Lexicon</i> (following
Heyne), is certainly wrong; for then the word cannot
be pronounced without throwing an accent on the
first syllable as well as the third, and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μέγας
<b>κοῤῥυθαιόλλος</b> Ἕκτωρ</span> would have been to a
Greek as intolerable an ending for a hexameter
line as ‘accurst <i>orphanhood-destined</i> houses’ would
be to us. The best authorities, accordingly,
accent <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κορυθαίολος</span> as a proparoxytonon.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f34'>
<p class='c005'><span class='label'><a href='#r34'>34</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Dr Hawtrey also has translated this passage; but
here, he has not, I think, been so successful as in his
‘Helen on the walls of Troy’.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f35'>
<p class='c005'><span class='label'><a href='#r35'>35</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>He attacks the same line also in <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> <a href='#Page_44'>44</a>; but I do
not claim this as a mark, how free I am from the
fault.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f36'>
<p class='c005'><span class='label'><a href='#r36'>36</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>If I had used such a double dative, as ‘to Peleus
to a mortal’, what would he have said of my syntax?</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f37'>
<p class='c005'><span class='label'><a href='#r37'>37</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Ballad-<i>manner</i>! The prevalent ballad-<i>metre</i> is
the Common Metre of our Psalm tunes: and yet he
assumes that whatever is in this metre must be on the
same level. I have professed (<abbr title='preface'>Pref.</abbr> <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> <abbr title='10'>x</abbr>) that our
<i>existing</i> old ballads are ‘poor and mean’, and are
not my pattern.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f38'>
<p class='c005'><span class='label'><a href='#r38'>38</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>He has also overlooked the misprint <i>Trojans</i>,
where I wrote <i>Troïans</i> (in three syllables), and has
thus spoiled one verse out of the five.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f39'>
<p class='c005'><span class='label'><a href='#r39'>39</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>As a literary curiosity I append the sentence of a
learned reviewer concerning this metre of Campbell.
‘It is a metre fit for introducing anything or translating
anything; a metre that <i>nothing can elevate, or
degrade, or improve, or spoil</i>; in which all subjects
will sound alike. A theorem of Euclid, a leading
article from the <i>Times</i>, a dialogue from the last new
novel, could all be reduced to it with the slightest
possible verbal alteration’. [Quite true of Greek
hexameter or Shakspeare’s line. It is a <i>virtue</i> in
the metres]. ‘To such a mill all would be grist that
came near it, and <i>in no grain that had once passed
through it would human ingenuity ever detect again
a characteristic quality</i>’. This writer is a stout
maintainer that English ballad metre is the right
one for translating Homer: only, somehow, he shuts
his eyes to the fact that Campbell’s <i>is</i> ballad metre!
Sad to say, extravagant and absurd assertions, like
these, though anonymous, can, by a parade of learning,
do much damage to the sale of a book in verse.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f40'>
<p class='c005'><span class='label'><a href='#r40'>40</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I think he has mistaken the <i>summit</i> of the wave
for a <i>headland</i>, and has made a single description
into two, by the word <i>Or</i>: but I now confine my regard
to the metre and general effect of the style.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f41'>
<p class='c005'><span class='label'><a href='#r41'>41</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><i>Companion</i>, in four syllables, is in Shakspeare’s
style; with whom habitually the termination <i>-tion</i>
is two.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f42'>
<p class='c005'><span class='label'><a href='#r42'>42</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>By corrupting the past tenses of <i>welisso</i> into a
false similarity to the past tenses of <i>elelizo</i>, the old
editors superimposed a new and false sense on the
latter verb; which still holds its place in our dictionaries,
as it deceived the Greeks themselves.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f43'>
<p class='c005'><span class='label'><a href='#r43'>43</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>That λλ <i>in Attic</i> was sounded like French <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>l
mouillée</i></span>, is judged probable by the learned writer
of the article L (Penny Cyclop.), who urges that
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μᾶλλον</span> is for <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μάλιον</span>, and compares <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φυλλο</span> with <i>folio</i>,
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αλλο</span> with <i>alio</i>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἁλλ</span> with <i>sali</i>.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f44'>
<p class='c005'><span class='label'><a href='#r44'>44</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Men who can bear ‘belch’ in poetry, nowadays
pretend that ‘sputter’ is indelicate. They find
Homer’s <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀποπτύει</span> to be ‘elegant’, but <i>sputter</i>—not!
‘No one would guess from Mr Newman’s coarse
phrases how <i>elegant</i> is Homer’!!</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f45'>
<p class='c005'><span class='label'><a href='#r45'>45</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In a Note to my translation (overlooked by more
than one critic) I have explained <i>curl-ey’d</i>, carefully,
but not very accurately perhaps; as I had not before
me the picture of the Hindoo lady to which I referred.
The whole <i>upper eyelid</i>, when <i>open</i>, may be called
the curl; for it is shaped like a buffalo’s horns. This
accounts for <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἑλικοβλέφαρος</span>, ‘having a curly eye<i>lid</i>’.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f46'>
<p class='c005'><span class='label'><a href='#r46'>46</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I thought I had toned it down pretty well, in
rendering it ‘O gentle friend’! Mr Arnold rebukes
me for this, without telling me what I ought to say,
or what is my fault. One thing is certain, that the
Greek is most <i>odd</i> and peculiar.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f47'>
<p class='c005'><span class='label'><a href='#r47'>47</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In the noble simile of the sea-tide, quoted <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> <a href='#Page_138'>138</a>
above, only the two first of its five lines are to the
purpose. Mr Gladstone, seduced by rhyme, has so
tapered off the point of the similitude, that only a
microscopic reader will see it.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f48'>
<p class='c005'><span class='label'><a href='#r48'>48</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It is very singular that Mr Gladstone should
imagine such a poet to have no eye for colour. I
totally protest against his turning Homer’s paintings
into leadpencil drawings. I believe that <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γλαυκὸς</span> is
grey (silvergreen), <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χάροψ</span> blue; and that <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πρασινὸς</span>,
‘leek-colour’, was too mean a word for any poets,
early or late, to use for ‘green’, therefore <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χλωρὸς</span>
does duty for it. <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Κῦμα πορφύρεον</span> is surely ‘the
purple wave’, and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἰοειδέα πόντον</span> ‘the violet sea’.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f49'>
<p class='c005'><span class='label'><a href='#r49'>49</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>He pares down <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἑλκηθμοῖο</span> (the dragging away of a
woman by the hair) into ‘captivity’! Better surely
is my ‘ignoble’ version: ‘Ere-that I see thee <i>dragg’d
away</i>, and hear thy shriek of anguish’.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f50'>
<p class='c005'><span class='label'><a href='#r50'>50</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>He means <i>ours</i> for two syllables. ‘Swiftness of
ours’ is surely ungrammatical. ‘A galley of my own’ =
one of my own galleys; but ‘a father of mine’,
is absurd, since each has but one father. I confess
I have myself been seduced into writing ‘those two
eyes of his’, to avoid ‘<i>those his</i> two eyes’: but I have
since condemned and altered it.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f51'>
<p class='c005'><span class='label'><a href='#r51'>51</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Of course no peculiarity of phrase has <i>the effect</i> of

<p class='c005'><span class='label'><a href='#r53'>53</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I do not see that Mr Arnold has any right to
reproach <i>me</i>, because <i>he</i> does not know Spenser’s
word ‘bragly’ (which I may have used twice in the
Iliad), or Dryden’s word ‘plump’, for a mass. The
former is so near in sound to <i>brag</i> and <i>braw</i>, that an
Englishman who is once told that it means ‘proudly
fine’, ought thenceforward to find it very intelligible:
the latter is a noble modification of the vulgar <i>lump</i>.
That he can carp as he does against these words and
against <i>bulkin</i> (= young bullock) as unintelligible, is
a testimony how little I have imposed of difficulty
on my readers. Those who know <i>lambkin</i> cannot
find <i>bulkin</i> very hard. Since writing the above, I
see a learned writer in the Philological Museum illustrates
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἴλη</span> by the old English phrase ‘a plump of
spears’.</p>

for reasons very opposite to those which he assigns.
I have ‘unfortunately’ given to querulous critics a
cue for attacking me unjustly. I should rather have
said: ‘We ought to be <i>quaint</i>, and not to shrink
from that which the fastidious modern will be sure
to call <i>grotesque</i> in English, when he is too blunted

<div class='footnote' id='f63'>
<p class='c005'><span class='label'><a href='#r63'>63</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Substantially, however, in the question at issue
between Mr Munro and Mr Spedding, I agree with
Mr Munro. By the italicized words in the following
sentence, ‘The rhythm of the Virgilian hexameter
depends entirely on <i>cæsura</i>, <i>pause</i>, and a due arrangement
of words’, he has touched, it seems to
me, in the constitution of this hexameter, the central
point which Mr Spedding misses. The accent, or
<i>heightened tone</i>, of Virgil in reading his own hexameters,
was probably far from being the same thing
as the accent or <i>stress</i> with which we read them.
The general effect of each line, in Virgil’s mouth,
was probably therefore something widely different
from what Mr Spedding assumes it to have been: an
ancient’s accentual reading was something which
allowed the metrical beat of the Latin line to be far
more perceptible than our accentual reading allows it
to be.</p>

<p class='c005'>On the question as to the <i>real</i> rhythm of the ancient
hexameter, Mr Newman has in his <i>Reply</i> a page quite
admirable for force and precision. Here he is in his
element, and his ability and acuteness have their
proper scope. But it is true that the <i>modern</i> reading
of the ancient hexameter is what the modern
hexameter has to imitate, and that the English reading
of the Virgilian hexameter is as Mr Spedding describes
it. Why this reading has not been imitated by the
English hexameter, I have tried to point out in the
text.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f64'>
<p class='c005'><span class='label'><a href='#r64'>64</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Such a minor change I have attempted by occasionally
shifting, in the first foot of the hexameter,
the accent from the first syllable to the second. In
the current English hexameter, it is on the first.
Mr Spedding, who proposes radically to subvert the
constitution of this hexameter, seems not to understand
that anyone can propose to modify it partially;
he can comprehend revolution in this metre, but not
reform. Accordingly he asks me how I can bring
myself to say, ‘<i>Bé</i>tween that and the ships’, or
‘<i>Thére</i> sat fifty men’; or how I can reconcile such
forcing of the accent with my own rule, that ‘hexameters
must <i>read themselves</i>’. Presently he says that
he cannot believe I do pronounce these words so, but
that he thinks I leave out the accent in the first foot
altogether, and thus get a hexameter with only five
accents. He will pardon me: I pronounce, as I
suppose he himself does, if he reads the words
naturally, ‘Be<i>tween</i> that and the ships’, and ‘There
<i>sát</i> fifty men’. Mr Spedding is familiar enough with
this accent on the second syllable in Virgil’s hexameters;
in ‘et <i>té</i> montosæ’, or ‘Ve<i>ló</i>ces jaculo’.
Such a change is an attempt to relieve the monotony
of the current English hexameter by occasionally
altering the position of one of its accents; it is not
an attempt to make a wholly new English hexameter
by habitually altering the position of four of them.
Very likely it is an unsuccessful attempt; but at any-rate
it does not violate what I think is the fundamental
rule for English hexameters, that may be such
as to <i>read themselves</i> without necessitating, on the
reader’s part, any non-natural putting-on or taking-off
accent. Hexameters like these of Mr Longfellow,</p>

<p class='c008'>violate this rule; and they are very common. I think

</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f65'>
<p class='c005'><span class='label'><a href='#r65'>65</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>As I welcome another more recent attempt in
stanza,—Mr Worsley’s version of the <i>Odyssey</i> in
Spenser’s measure. Mr Worsley does me the honour
to notice some remarks of mine on this measure: I
had said that its greater intricacy made it a worse
measure than even the ten-syllable couplet to employ
for rendering Homer. He points out, in answer,
that ‘the more complicated the correspondences in
a poetical measure, the less obtrusive and absolute
are the rhymes’. This is true, and subtly remarked;
but I never denied that the single shocks of rhyme
in the couplet were more <i>strongly felt</i> than those in
the stanza; I said that the more frequent recurrence
of the same rhyme, in the stanza, necessarily made
this measure more <i>intricate</i>. The stanza repacks
Homer’s matter yet more arbitrarily, and therefore
changes his movement yet more radically, than the
couplet. Accordingly, I imagine a nearer approach
to a perfect translation of Homer is possible in the
couplet, well managed, than in the stanza, however
well managed. But meanwhile Mr Worsley, applying
the Spenserian stanza, that beautiful romantic measure,
to the most romantic poem of the ancient world;
making this stanza yield him, too (what it never
yielded to Byron), its treasures of fluidity and sweet
ease; above all, bringing to his task a truly poetical
sense and skill, has produced a version of the <i>Odyssey</i>
much the most pleasing of those hitherto produced,
and which is delightful to read.</p>

<p class='c005'>For the public this may well be enough, nay, more
than enough; but for the critic even this is not yet
quite enough.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f66'>
<p class='c005'><span class='label'><a href='#r66'>66</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I speak of poetic genius as employing itself upon
narrative or dramatic poetry,—poetry in which the
poet has to go out of himself and to create. In
lyrical poetry, in the direct expression of personal
feeling, the most subtle genius may, under the
momentary pressure of passion, express itself simply.
Even here, however, the native tendency will generally
be discernible.</p>
